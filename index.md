The goal of the `mvgam` 📦 is to fit Bayesian Dynamic Generalized
Additive Models (DGAMs) that can include highly flexible nonlinear
predictor effects for both process and observation components. The
package does this by relying on functionalities from the impressive
<a href="https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/"
target="_blank"><code>brms</code></a> and
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=mgcv"
target="_blank"><code>mgcv</code></a> packages. Parameters are estimated
using the probabilistic programming language
[`Stan`](https://mc-stan.org/), giving users access to the most advanced
Bayesian inference algorithms available. This allows `mvgam` to fit a
very wide range of models, including:

## Installation

Install the stable version from `CRAN` using:
`install.packages('mvgam')`, or install the development version from
`GitHub` using: `devtools::install_github("nicholasjclark/mvgam")`. You
will also need a working version of `Stan` installed (along with either
`rstan` and/or `cmdstanr`). Please refer to installation links for
`Stan` with `rstan` <a href="https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan"
target="_blank">here</a>, or for `Stan` with `cmdstandr`
<a href="https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Cheatsheet

## Getting started

`mvgam` was originally designed to analyse and forecast non-negative
integer-valued data (counts). These data are traditionally challenging
to analyse with existing time-series analysis packages. But further
development of `mvgam` has resulted in support for a growing number of
observation families that extend to other types of data. Currently, the
package can handle data for the following families:

- `gaussian()` for real-valued data
- `student_t()` for heavy-tailed real-valued data
- `lognormal()` for non-negative real-valued data
- `Gamma()` for non-negative real-valued data
- `betar()` for proportional data on `(0,1)`
- `bernoulli()` for binary data
- `poisson()` for count data
- `nb()` for overdispersed count data
- `binomial()` for count data with known number of trials
- `beta_binomial()` for overdispersed count data with known number of
  trials
- `nmix()` for count data with imperfect detection (unknown number of
  trials)

See `?mvgam_families` for more information. Below is a simple example
for simulating and modelling proportional data with `Beta` observations
over a set of seasonal series with independent Gaussian Process dynamic
trends:

``` r
set.seed(100)
data <- sim_mvgam(
  family = betar(),
  T = 80,
  trend_model = GP(),
  prop_trend = 0.5, 
  seasonality = 'shared'
)
```

Plot the series to see how they evolve over time

``` r
plot_mvgam_series(
  data = data$data_train, 
  series = 'all'
)
```

<figure>
<img src="man/figures/README-beta_sim-1.png"
alt="Visualizing multivariate proportional time series using the mvgam R package #rstats" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Visualizing multivariate proportional
time series using the mvgam R package #rstats</figcaption>
</figure>

Fit a State-Space GAM to these series that uses a hierarchical cyclic
seasonal smooth term to capture variation in seasonality among series.
The model also includes series-specific latent Gaussian Processes with
squared exponential covariance functions to capture temporal dynamics

``` r
mod <- mvgam(
  y ~ s(season, bs = 'cc', k = 7) +
    s(season, by = series, m = 1, k = 5),
  trend_model = GP(),
  data = data$data_train,
  newdata = data$data_test,
  family = betar()
)
```

Plot the estimated posterior hindcast and forecast distributions for
each series

``` r
library(patchwork)
fc <- forecast(mod)
wrap_plots(
  plot(fc, series = 1), 
  plot(fc, series = 2), 
  plot(fc, series = 3), 
  ncol = 2
)
```

alt="Forecasting multivariate time series with Dynamic Generalized Additive Models" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Forecasting multivariate time series with

</figure>

Various `S3` functions can be used to inspect parameter estimates, plot
smooth functions and residuals, and evaluate models through posterior
predictive checks or forecast comparisons. Please see [the package
documentation](https://nicholasjclark.github.io/mvgam/reference/index.html)
for more detailed examples.

## Vignettes

You can set `build_vignettes = TRUE` when installing but be aware this
will slow down the installation drastically. Instead, you can always
access the vignette htmls online at
<https://nicholasjclark.github.io/mvgam/articles/>

## Citing `mvgam` and related software

When using any software please make sure to appropriately acknowledge
the hard work that developers and maintainers put into making these
packages available. Citations are currently the best way to formally
acknowledge this work (but feel free to ⭐ [the
repo](https://github.com/nicholasjclark/mvgam) as well), so we highly
encourage you to cite any packages that you rely on for your research.

When using `mvgam`, please cite the following:

> Clark, N.J. and Wells, K. (2023). Dynamic Generalized Additive Models
> (DGAMs) for forecasting discrete ecological time series. *Methods in
> Ecology and Evolution*. DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13974>

As `mvgam` acts as an interface to `Stan`, please additionally cite:

> Carpenter B., Gelman A., Hoffman M. D., Lee D., Goodrich B.,
> Betancourt M., Brubaker M., Guo J., Li P., and Riddell A. (2017).
> Stan: A probabilistic programming language. *Journal of Statistical
> Software*. 76(1). DOI: <https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v076.i01>

`mvgam` relies on several other `R` packages and, of course, on `R`
itself. To find out how to cite `R` and its packages, use `citation()`.
There are some features of `mvgam` which specifically rely on certain
packages. The most important of these is the generation of data
necessary to estimate smoothing splines and Gaussian Processes, which
rely on the `mgcv`, `brms` and `splines2` packages. The `rstan` and
`cmdstanr` packages together with `Rcpp` makes `Stan` conveniently
accessible in `R`. If you use some of these features, please also
consider citing the related packages.

## Other resources

A number of case studies and step-by-step webinars have been compiled to
highlight how GAMs and DGAMs can be useful for analysing multivariate
