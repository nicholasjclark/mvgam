# mvgam Refactoring Current Status

**Date**: 2025-01-26  
**Branch**: feature/brms-integration  
**Phase**: Phase 1, Week 2 - Formula Integration & Autocorrelation Validation âœ… **COMPLETE**

## Week 1 Completed âœ…

1. **Project Setup**
   - Created `feature/brms-integration` branch
   - Committed comprehensive refactoring plan (`mvgam-brms-refactoring-plan.md`)
   - Updated `.Rbuildignore` to exclude plan from package builds
   - Enhanced CLAUDE.md with development standards

2. **Foundation Architecture**
   - Created `R/trend_dispatcher.R` with comprehensive validation framework
   - Implemented checkmate/insight/rlang validation patterns
   - Added dynamic factor model constraint validation
   - Created `custom_trend()` function for user extensions
   - Added `print.mvgam_trend()` method with proper display

3. **Enhanced Trend Constructors**
   - Updated `R/mvgam_trend_types.R` with dispatcher integration
   - Added flexible AR lag support: `AR(p = c(1, 12, 24))` for seasonal models
   - Added any-order VAR support: `VAR(p = 5)`
   - Integrated comprehensive validation with modular helper functions
   - Applied consistent error handling and user-friendly messages

4. **Formula Support System**
   - Implemented comprehensive formula parsing with `parse_trend_formula()`
   - Added centralized trend registry for extensible detection
   - Created order-independent formula parsing (maintains user formula order)
   - Proper handling of regular terms, trend constructors, and offset terms
   - Integrated with existing mvgam patterns (like interpret_mvgam)

5. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Created `tests/testthat/test-trend-dispatcher.R` with 132 test cases
   - Verified order-independent formula parsing
   - Tested edge cases and real-world scenarios
   - Validated dynamic factor model constraints
   - Confirmed proper GAM syntax validation

## Week 1 Test Results âœ…

**Final Status**: `[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 132 ]`
- All trend dispatcher functionality tested and validated
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Real-world scenario testing passed
- Formula parsing robustness confirmed

## Week 2 Completed âœ…

1. **brms Formula Integration**
   - Implemented comprehensive validation system in `R/brms_validation.R`
   - Added support for all brms formula types: `bf()`, `mvbind()`, `set_rescor()`
   - Created `validate_autocor_separation()` for proper separation between brms and mvgam
   - Enhanced `formula2str_mvgam()` to handle complex brms formula objects

2. **Advanced Formula Support**
   - Full distributional regression support: `bf(y ~ x, sigma ~ z)`
   - Nonlinear model support: `bf(y ~ a * exp(b * x), a + b ~ 1, nl = TRUE)`
   - Multivariate model support: `bf(mvbind(y1, y2) ~ x) + set_rescor(TRUE)`
   - Mixed pattern combinations for complex modeling scenarios

3. **Multivariate Trend Identification**
   - Allow response variables in `trend_formula` for multivariate identification
   - Support `trend_formula = bf(count ~ AR(p = 1), biomass ~ RW(cor = TRUE))`
   - Enhanced `validate_bf_trend_formula()` with comprehensive extraction
   - Created `extract_all_bf_formulas()` helper for complete validation

4. **Context-Aware Validation**
   - Minimal validation for observation formulas (let brms handle most)
   - Comprehensive validation for trend formulas (State-Space requirements)
   - Proper offset handling: allowed in observation, forbidden in trends
   - Autocorrelation separation: brms in observation, mvgam in trends

5. **Dependency Management**
   - Moved brms from Imports to Depends in DESCRIPTION for auto-loading
   - Removed conflicting exports (bernoulli, beta_binomial, lognormal, student, t2, s)
   - Cleaned up function conflicts between mvgam and brms
   - Enhanced startup system following existing mvgam patterns

## Week 2 Test Results âœ…

**Final Status**: `[ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 100 ]`
- All brms validation functionality tested and validated
- Complex formula patterns working correctly
- Multivariate identification system operational
- Context-aware autocorrelation separation functioning

## Next Steps ðŸŽ¯

**Ready for Week 3**: brms Setup Optimization

## Key Architecture Decisions Made

- **Validation Framework**: Using checkmate/insight/rlang throughout
- **Export Strategy**: Only export user-facing functions (`custom_trend()`, methods)
- **Code Style**: 80-character limits, proper roxygen indentation, sentence case
- **Dynamic Factor Constraints**: Strict validation for identifiability
- **Extension Pattern**: Users can add custom trends via `custom_trend()`

## Files Modified

### Week 1 Files
- `mvgam-brms-refactoring-plan.md` - Complete 16-week implementation plan
- `.Rbuildignore` - Added plan exclusion
- `CLAUDE.md` - Enhanced development standards
- `R/trend_dispatcher.R` - New validation and dispatcher system

### Week 2 Files  
- `R/brms_validation.R` - Comprehensive brms formula validation system
- `tests/testthat/test-brms-validation.R` - 100 test cases for formula validation
- `DESCRIPTION` - Moved brms from Imports to Depends
- `NAMESPACE` - Removed conflicting brms exports (user manually fixed)
- `R/families.R` - Removed @export tags from conflicting wrappers (user manually fixed)
- `R/zzz.R` - Enhanced startup system with brms compatibility message

## Current Branch Status

```bash
git status
# On branch feature/brms-integration  
# Modified: R/validations.R (likely from user manual fixes)
# Ready for Week 3 implementation
```

## Next Session Pickup Point

**Ready for Week 3**: brms Setup Optimization - Focus on integrating the validation system with existing mvgam workflow, optimizing brms posterior processing, and implementing dual-architecture compatibility patterns as outlined in the refactoring plan.
