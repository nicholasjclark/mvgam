# Comprehensive Joint Species Exploration Dashboard

## Implementation: Create explore_jsdm_data() function that generates an interactive HTML report

Features:
- Species accumulation curves and rarefaction analysis to assess sampling completeness
- Environmental gradient analysis with species turnover along gradients
- Preliminary ordination (PCA, NMDS) with environmental fitting
- Missing data patterns and sampling bias assessment
- Species co-occurrence matrix with significance testing
- Collinearity diagnostics for environmental predictors

## Why this matters: 
No existing JSDM package provides comprehensive pre-analysis data exploration. This would help users understand their data structure, identify potential issues, and make informed modeling decisions before fitting computationally expensive models.

# Cross-Validation Concepts for JSDM Models

## Overview

Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDMs) present unique challenges for cross-validation and model selection. Unlike single-species models, JSDMs capture complex dependencies between species, sites, and environmental factors. Traditional cross-validation approaches may not adequately test these multivariate relationships, making specialized CV methods essential for robust model evaluation.

## Why Standard CV Approaches Fall Short

**Standard approaches assume independence**: Traditional CV methods treat observations as independent, but JSDM data contains:
- **Spatial dependencies** between nearby sites
- **Species associations** through shared environmental responses
- **Community-level constraints** on species richness and composition
- **Latent factor structure** that links species responses

**Computational challenges**: Refitting complex Bayesian JSDM models for each CV fold is computationally prohibitive, especially with large community datasets and complex factor structures.

## Phase 1: Core CV Capabilities

### Leave-Site-Out Cross-Validation

**Purpose**: Test the model's ability to predict community composition at unsampled locations.

**Ecological Relevance**: 
- Mirrors real-world scenarios where ecologists survey new sites
- Tests spatial generalization beyond the training data
- Validates environmental-species relationship extrapolation
- Assesses factor model performance in novel locations

**PSIS Implementation**:
Rather than refitting the model excluding each site, Pareto Smoothed Importance Sampling (PSIS) approximates the posterior distribution without the held-out site. This leverages the existing posterior draws by reweighting them based on the likelihood contributions of the excluded site.

**Key Advantages**:
- **Computational efficiency**: No model refitting required
- **Spatial realism**: Tests ecologically meaningful prediction scenarios
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Provides prediction intervals for new sites
- **Model comparison**: Enables direct comparison of different JSDM formulations

**Diagnostic Value**: Poor leave-site-out performance indicates:
- Missing important environmental predictors
- Inadequate spatial basis functions
- Overfitting to specific site characteristics
- Insufficient factor complexity for community patterns

### Leave-Species-Out Cross-Validation

**Purpose**: Evaluate whether the model captures fundamental community assembly rules that can predict unseen species.

**Ecological Relevance**:
- **Invasion ecology**: Can the model predict where new species might establish?
- **Conservation**: How well does the model predict rare species from community patterns?
- **Assembly rules**: Does the model capture generalizable species-environment relationships?
- **Factor interpretation**: Are latent factors ecologically meaningful across species?

**PSIS Implementation**:
For each held-out species, PSIS reweights posterior draws based on the likelihood of the remaining community. The factor loadings and environmental responses of other species inform predictions for the excluded species through shared latent structure.

**Methodological Innovation**:
This approach is unique to JSDMs and impossible with single-species models. It explicitly tests whether the multivariate factor structure captures meaningful ecological patterns rather than just statistical convenience.

**Key Advantages**:
- **Community-level validation**: Tests factor model biological relevance
- **Predictive ecology**: Assesses model utility for novel species prediction
- **Assembly rule validation**: Confirms whether environmental filtering and biotic interactions are captured
- **Factor adequacy**: Determines if latent dimensions represent real ecological gradients

**Diagnostic Value**: Poor leave-species-out performance suggests:
- Factors capture statistical noise rather than ecological processes
- Insufficient environmental covariates for species prediction
- Overfitting to specific species characteristics
- Inadequate factor dimensionality for community structure

## PSIS Implementation for JSDM Models

### Core Concept
PSIS approximates leave-one-out cross-validation by:
1. **Identifying influential observations** through Pareto-k diagnostics
2. **Reweighting posterior draws** based on likelihood contributions
3. **Approximating the posterior** that would result from excluding specific data points
4. **Providing uncertainty estimates** for the approximation quality

### JSDM-Specific Adaptations

**Multivariate likelihood handling**: Unlike univariate time series, JSDMs have multivariate responses requiring careful treatment of cross-species dependencies in the likelihood calculations.

**Factor structure preservation**: When excluding sites or species, the latent factor structure must be maintained while appropriately handling the missing components.

**Spatial correlation considerations**: For spatially explicit models, PSIS weights must account for spatial dependencies that affect the exclusion impact.

**Community-level metrics**: Evaluation metrics focus on community-level predictions (richness, composition, beta diversity) rather than just individual species accuracy.

## Validation Metrics for JSDM Cross-Validation

### Site-Level Metrics
- **Species richness prediction accuracy**: How well does the model predict the number of species at held-out sites?
- **Community composition similarity**: Bray-Curtis or Jaccard similarity between predicted and observed communities
- **Abundance prediction accuracy**: For count data, how accurately are species abundances predicted?
- **Presence-absence accuracy**: For binary data, classification accuracy across species

### Species-Level Metrics
- **Environmental response consistency**: Do predicted species responses match known ecological preferences?
- **Factor loading stability**: Are species factor loadings consistent when predicted from community patterns?
- **Niche prediction accuracy**: How well does the model predict species environmental optima and tolerances?
- **Co-occurrence pattern prediction**: Does the model accurately predict which species occur together?

### Community-Level Metrics
- **Beta diversity preservation**: Does the model maintain realistic levels of community turnover?
- **Assembly rule validation**: Are ecological assembly constraints (e.g., competitive exclusion) respected?
- **Functional diversity patterns**: For trait-based models, are functional diversity patterns maintained?
- **Spatial pattern consistency**: Do spatial autocorrelation patterns match observations?

## Computational Efficiency and Diagnostics

### Performance Optimization
**Vectorized operations**: PSIS calculations leverage vectorized operations across species and sites simultaneously, dramatically reducing computation time compared to repeated model fitting.

**Memory management**: Efficient handling of large posterior arrays (draws × sites × species) through chunked processing and selective memory usage.

**Parallel processing**: Independent PSIS calculations for different sites/species enable straightforward parallelization across available cores.

### Quality Diagnostics
**Pareto-k diagnostics**: Identify when PSIS approximations are unreliable and full model refitting may be necessary for specific sites or species.

**Effective sample size monitoring**: Track whether sufficient posterior draws remain after importance sampling for reliable inference.

**Approximation quality assessment**: Compare PSIS results with exact calculations for subsets of data to validate approximation accuracy.

## Integration with Model Selection

### Factor Number Selection
Compare models with different numbers of latent factors using consistent CV approaches to identify optimal model complexity without overfitting.

### Covariate Selection
Evaluate the predictive value of different environmental covariates or covariate transformations through systematic CV comparison.

### Spatial Structure Comparison
Test different spatial basis functions or spatial random effect formulations to optimize spatial prediction accuracy.

### Model Family Comparison
Compare different response distributions (Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated) based on predictive performance rather than just likelihood-based criteria.

## Advantages Over Existing JSDM Packages

### Computational Superiority
Current JSDM packages either lack comprehensive CV capabilities or require computationally prohibitive refitting approaches. mvgam's PSIS-based CV provides:
- **Orders of magnitude faster** computation than refit-based approaches
- **More comprehensive validation** than packages offering only basic CV
- **Robust uncertainty quantification** through proper Bayesian treatment

### Ecological Relevance
Unlike generic statistical CV approaches, mvgam's CV methods are designed specifically for ecological questions:
- **Ecologically meaningful prediction scenarios** (new sites, novel species)
- **Community-level validation metrics** beyond individual species accuracy
- **Assembly rule testing** through species-level cross-validation

### Model Selection Framework
Provides the most comprehensive model selection framework available for JSDMs:
- **Multiple CV perspectives** (site-based, species-based, hierarchical)
- **Consistent comparison metrics** across different model formulations
- **Computational feasibility** for comparing complex model alternatives

This Phase 1 implementation would establish mvgam as having the most sophisticated and practical cross-validation capabilities in the JSDM software ecosystem, enabling robust model selection while maintaining computational efficiency.

# Custom Posterior Predictive Checks for JSDM Models

## Overview

Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDMs) have unique characteristics that require specialized posterior predictive checks beyond standard regression diagnostics. These custom checks leverage the `bayesplot` framework to provide ecologically meaningful model validation for multispecies community data.

## Why Custom Checks are Needed

Standard posterior predictive checks focus on individual response variables, but JSDMs model:
- **Community-level patterns** (species richness, beta diversity)
- **Cross-species relationships** (residual correlations, factor structures)
- **Spatial and temporal dependencies** across multiple species
- **Ecological constraints** (zero-inflation patterns, abundance distributions)

## Community-Level Diagnostics

### Species Richness Distribution
**Purpose**: Validate whether the model captures the distribution of species richness across sites.

**What it checks**: 
- Does the predicted range of species richness match observations?
- Are extremely species-rich or species-poor sites predicted appropriately?
- Is the overall shape of the richness distribution captured?

**Ecological insight**: Poor fit suggests the model isn't capturing fundamental community assembly processes.

### Beta Diversity Patterns
**Purpose**: Assess whether the model reproduces community turnover patterns.

**What it checks**:
- Does the model capture the overall level of compositional dissimilarity between sites?
- Are predicted community similarities consistent with observations?
- Different dissimilarity metrics (Bray-Curtis, Jaccard) may reveal different model weaknesses.

**Ecological insight**: Failure to capture beta diversity suggests missing environmental drivers or spatial processes.

## Species-Specific Diagnostics

### Zero-Inflation Assessment
**Purpose**: Evaluate whether the model appropriately handles species absence patterns.

**What it checks**:
- Does each species show the correct proportion of zero observations?
- Are rare species being predicted as too common, or common species as too rare?
- Species-specific validation of presence/absence patterns.

**Ecological insight**: Systematic mismatches indicate problems with detection probability, environmental filtering, or species-specific model components.

### Abundance Distribution Validation
**Purpose**: Check whether species-specific abundance patterns are captured.

**What it checks**:
- Shape of abundance distributions (log-normal, negative binomial, etc.)
- Extreme abundance events (population outbreaks, crashes)
- Species-specific distributional assumptions.

**Ecological insight**: Poor fit suggests inappropriate distributional assumptions or missing covariates affecting that species.

## Spatial and Temporal Pattern Validation

### Spatial Autocorrelation in Residuals
**Purpose**: Detect remaining spatial structure not captured by the model.

**What it checks**:
- Moran's I statistics for residuals across species
- Whether spatial processes are adequately modeled
- Scale-dependent spatial patterns in model failures.

**Ecological insight**: Significant spatial autocorrelation in residuals indicates missing spatial covariates, inappropriate spatial basis functions, or unmodeled dispersal processes.

### Temporal Trend Capture
**Purpose**: Validate whether temporal dynamics are appropriately modeled.

**What it checks**:
- Species-specific trend slopes (increasing, decreasing, stable)
- Seasonal or cyclical patterns
- Synchrony across species in temporal changes.

**Ecological insight**: Trend mismatches suggest missing temporal covariates, inappropriate temporal basis functions, or unmodeled environmental change.

## Factor Structure Diagnostics

### Loading Stability Assessment
**Purpose**: Evaluate the reliability and interpretability of latent factor loadings.

**What it checks**:
- Posterior uncertainty in species loadings on each factor
- Which species have reliable associations with latent axes
- Factor interpretability and ecological meaningfulness.

**Ecological insight**: High uncertainty or inconsistent loadings suggest over-parameterization, weak latent structure, or insufficient data for the number of factors.

### Factor Score Consistency
**Purpose**: Validate that latent factor scores are internally consistent.

**What it checks**:
- Correspondence between fitted factor scores and scores reconstructed from species loadings
- Internal consistency of the latent variable model
- Identifiability of factor structure.

**Ecological insight**: Poor correspondence indicates model identifiability issues or numerical instability in factor estimation.

## Implementation Strategy

### Integration with bayesplot
All custom checks follow `bayesplot` design principles:
- Consistent visual aesthetics and color schemes
- Standardized plot layouts and annotations
- Proper uncertainty visualization (intervals, densities)
- Professional publication-ready output

### Modular Design
Custom checks are designed as:
- **Individual functions** for specific diagnostics
- **Integrated dashboard** for comprehensive model validation
- **Flexible parameters** for different data types and research questions
- **Automatic interpretation** guidance for non-experts

### Ecological Interpretation
Each check provides:
- **Statistical assessment** of model fit
- **Ecological interpretation** of what poor fit means
- **Suggested remedies** for common model failures
- **Guidance on model refinement** based on diagnostic results

## Advantages Over Existing Approaches

### Compared to Standard PP Checks
- **Community-aware**: Considers multispecies patterns, not just individual responses
- **Ecologically meaningful**: Diagnostics directly relate to community assembly processes
- **Scale-appropriate**: Checks operate at relevant spatial and temporal scales

### Compared to Other JSDM Packages
- **Comprehensive suite**: Covers all major aspects of JSDM validation
- **Standardized framework**: Consistent visual and analytical approach
- **Interpretive guidance**: Helps users understand what diagnostics mean ecologically
- **Publication ready**: Professional plots requiring minimal customization

## Usage Philosophy

The goal is to make sophisticated model validation accessible to ecologists who may not be statistical experts. Each diagnostic should:

1. **Clearly indicate** whether the model is performing adequately
2. **Explain the ecological significance** of any problems detected
3. **Suggest next steps** for model improvement
4. **Provide publication-quality output** for methods sections

This approach transforms posterior predictive checking from a statistical exercise into an ecological learning tool that improves both model quality and scientific understanding.

## Integration with mvgam Workflow

These checks integrate seamlessly with mvgam's analytical pipeline:
- **Automatic execution** after model fitting
- **Smart defaults** based on model structure and data characteristics  
- **Interactive exploration** through dashboard interfaces
- **Export capabilities** for documentation and publication

By providing the most comprehensive and ecologically-informed model validation available in any JSDM package, mvgam establishes itself as the gold standard for rigorous community ecology modeling.

  if(is.null(scales)) {
    # Single-scale analysis
    beta_components <- calculate_beta_components(community_predictions, method)
  } else {
    # Multi-scale hierarchical analysis
    beta_components <- calculate_hierarchical_beta(community_predictions, scales, method)

```

## Step 4: Integrated Visualization Suite
**Goal**: Create publication-ready plots that automatically handle uncertainty and provide ecological insights.

  }
  
  if("assemblages" %in% type && !is.null(assemblages)) {
    plots$assemblages <- create_assemblage_plot(assemblages)
  }

    decomposition = create_beta_decomposition_plot(beta_results),
    mechanisms = if(!is.null(mechanisms)) create_mechanism_partition_plot(mechanisms) else NULL,
    distance_decay = create_distance_decay_plot(beta_results)
  )
  
  return(combine_plots(plots))
}
```

### User Experience:

# Automatic summary and plots
print(results)  # Ecological summary
results$gradient_plots  # Publication-ready gradient figures
results$beta_plots      # Publication-ready beta diversity figures
```

## Technical Notes

- All functions should handle MCMC uncertainty through posterior sampling
- Design for scalability (large datasets, many species)

This plan positions mvgam as the first JSDM package to seamlessly integrate statistical modeling with ecological interpretation, leveraging the unique strengths of factor loadings for gradient analysis.
