## mvgam
**M**ulti**V**ariate (Dynamic) **G**eneralized **A**ddivite **M**odels

The goal of `mvgam` is to fit Bayesian (Dynamic) Generalized Additive Models. This package constructs State-Space models that can include highly flexible nonlinear predictor effects for both process and observation components by leveraging functionalities from the impressive [`brms`](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/){target="_blank"} and [`mgcv`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html){target="_blank"} packages. This allows `mvgam` to fit a wide range of models, including hierarchical ecological models such as N-mixture or Joint Species Distribution models, as well as univariate and multivariate time series models with imperfect detection. The original motivation for the package is described in [Clark & Wells 2022](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13974){target="_blank"} (published in *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*), with additional inspiration on the use of Bayesian probabilistic modelling coming from [Michael Betancourt](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/){target="_blank"}, [Michael Dietze](https://www.bu.edu/earth/profiles/michael-dietze/){target="_blank"} and [Sarah Heaps](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/sarah-e-heaps/){target="_blank"}, among many others.
  
## Installation
Install the stable version from CRAN using: `install.packages('mvgam')`, or install the development version from `GitHub` using:
`devtools::install_github("nicholasjclark/mvgam")`. Note that to actually condition models with MCMC sampling, the `Stan` software must be installed (along with either `rstan` and/or `cmdstanr`). Only `rstan` is listed as a dependency of `mvgam` to ensure that installation is less difficult. If users wish to fit the models using `mvgam`, please refer to installation links for `Stan` with `rstan` [here](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan), or for `Stan` with `cmdstandr` [here](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/). You will need a fairly recent version of `Stan` (preferably 2.29 or above) to ensure all the model syntax is recognized. We highly recommend you use `Cmdstan` through the `cmdstanr` interface as the backend. This is because `Cmdstan` is easier to install, is more up to date with new features, and uses less memory than `Rstan`. See [this documentation from the `Cmdstan` team for more information](http://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html#comparison-with-rstan).

## Cheatsheet
[![`mvgam` usage cheatsheet](https://github.com/nicholasjclark/mvgam/raw/master/misc/mvgam_cheatsheet.png)](https://github.com/nicholasjclark/mvgam/raw/master/misc/mvgam_cheatsheet.pdf)

## Getting started
`mvgam` was originally designed to analyse and forecast non-negative integer-valued data (counts). These data are traditionally challenging to analyse with existing time-series analysis packages. But further development of `mvgam` has resulted in support for a growing number of observation families that extend to other types of data. Currently, the package can handle data for the following families:  
  
* `gaussian()` for real-valued data 
* `student_t()` for heavy-tailed real-valued data
* `lognormal()` for non-negative real-valued data
* `Gamma()` for non-negative real-valued data
* `betar()` for proportional data on `(0,1)`
* `bernoulli()` for binary data
* `poisson()` for count data
* `nb()` for overdispersed count data
* `binomial()` for count data with known number of trials
* `beta_binomial()` for overdispersed count data with known number of trials
* `nmix()` for count data with imperfect detection (unknown number of trials)
  
See `??mvgam_families` for more information. Below is a simple example for simulating and modelling proportional data with `Beta` observations over a set of seasonal series with independent Gaussian Process dynamic trends:
```{r, include = FALSE}
library(mvgam)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data <- sim_mvgam(family = betar(),
                  T = 80,
                  trend_model = GP(),
                  trend_rel = 0.5, 
                  seasonality = 'shared')
```

Plot the series to see how they evolve over time
```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot_mvgam_series(data = data$data_train, series = 'all')
```
![Simulating and analysing multivariate time series with Dynamic Generalized Additive Models](man/figures/README-beta_sim-1.png)

Fit a State-Space GAM to these series that uses a hierarchical cyclic seasonal smooth term to capture variation in seasonality among series. The model also includes series-specific latent Gaussian Processes with squared exponential covariance functions to capture temporal dynamics
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mod <- mvgam(y ~ s(season, bs = 'cc', k = 7) +
               s(season, by = series, m = 1, k = 5),
             trend_model = GP(),
             data = data$data_train,
             newdata = data$data_test,
             family = betar())
```

Plot the estimated posterior hindcast and forecast distributions for each series
```{r eval = FALSE}
layout(matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE))
for(i in 1:3){
  plot(mod, type = 'forecast', series = i)
}
```

![Forecasting multivariate time series with Dynamic Generalized Additive Models](man/figures/README-beta_fc-1.png)

Various `S3` functions can be used to inspect parameter estimates, plot smooth functions and residuals, and evaluate models through posterior predictive checks or forecast comparisons. Please see the package documentation for more detailed examples.

## Vignettes
You can set `build_vignettes = TRUE` when installing with either `devtools::install_github` or `remotes::install_github`, but be aware this will slow down the installation drastically. Instead, you can always access the vignette htmls online at [https://nicholasjclark.github.io/mvgam/articles/](https://nicholasjclark.github.io/mvgam/articles/)

## Other resources
A number of case studies have been compiled to highlight how GAMs and DGAMs can be useful for working with time series data:
  
* [Ecological Forecasting with Dynamic Generalized Additive Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zZopLlomsQ){target="_blank"}
* [State-Space Vector Autoregressions in `mvgam`](https://ecogambler.netlify.app/blog/vector-autoregressions/){target="_blank"}
* [How to interpret and report nonlinear effects from Generalized Additive Models](https://ecogambler.netlify.app/blog/interpreting-gams/){target="_blank"}
* [Phylogenetic smoothing using mgcv](https://ecogambler.netlify.app/blog/phylogenetic-smooths-mgcv/){target="_blank"}
* [Distributed lags (and hierarchical distributed lags) using mgcv and mvgam](https://ecogambler.netlify.app/blog/distributed-lags-mgcv/){target="_blank"}
* [Incorporating time-varying seasonality in forecast models](https://ecogambler.netlify.app/blog/time-varying-seasonality/){target="_blank"}
  
The package can also be used to generate all necessary data structures, initial value functions and modelling code necessary to fit DGAMs using `Stan`. This can be helpful if users wish to make changes to the model to better suit their own bespoke research / analysis goals.
