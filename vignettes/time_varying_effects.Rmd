The purpose of this vignette is to show how the `mvgam` package can be used to estimate and forecast regression coefficients that vary through time.

## Time-varying effects
Dynamic fixed-effect coefficients (often referred to as dynamic linear models) can be readily incorporated into GAMs / DGAMs. In `mvgam`, the `dynamic()` formula wrapper offers a convenient interface to set these up. The plan is to incorporate a range of dynamic options (such as random walk, AR1 etc...) but for the moment only low-rank Gaussian Process (GP) smooths are allowed (making use either of the `gp` basis in `mgcv` of of Hilbert space approximate GPs). These are advantageous over splines or random walk effects for several reasons. First, GPs will force the time-varying effect to be smooth. This often makes sense in reality, where we would not expect a regression coefficient to change rapidly from one time point to the next. Second, GPs provide information on the 'global' dynamics of a time-varying effect through their length-scale parameters. This means we can use them to provide accurate forecasts of how an effect is expected to change in the future, something that we couldn't do well if we used splines to estimate the effect. An example below illustrates.

### Simulating time-varying effects
Simulate a time-varying coefficient using a squared exponential Gaussian Process function with length scale $\rho$=10. We will do this using an internal function from `mvgam` (the `sim_gp` function):
```{r}
set.seed(1111)
N <- 200
beta_temp <- mvgam:::sim_gp(rnorm(1),
                            alpha_gp = 0.75,
                            rho_gp = 10,
                            h = N) + 0.5
```

A plot of the time-varying coefficient shows that it changes smoothly through time:
```{r, fig.alt = "Simulating time-varying effects in mvgam and R"}
plot(beta_temp, type = 'l', lwd = 3, 
     bty = 'l', xlab = 'Time', ylab = 'Coefficient',
     col = 'darkred')
box(bty = 'l', lwd = 2)
```

Next we need to simulate the values of the covariate, which we will call `temp` (to represent $temperature$). In this case we just use a standard normal distribution to simulate this covariate:
```{r}
temp <- rnorm(N, sd = 1)
```

Finally, simulate the outcome variable, which is a Gaussian observation process (with observation error) over the time-varying effect of $temperature$
```{r, fig.alt = "Simulating time-varying effects in mvgam and R"}
out <- rnorm(N, mean = 4 + beta_temp * temp,
             sd = 0.25)
time <- seq_along(temp)
plot(out,  type = 'l', lwd = 3, 
     bty = 'l', xlab = 'Time', ylab = 'Outcome',
     col = 'darkred')
box(bty = 'l', lwd = 2)
```

Gather the data into a `data.frame` for fitting models, and split the data into training and testing folds.
```{r}
data <- data.frame(out, temp, time)
data_train <- data[1:190,]
data_test <- data[191:200,]
```

### The `dynamic()` function
Time-varying coefficients can be fairly easily set up using the `s()` or `gp()` wrapper functions in `mvgam` formulae by fitting a nonlinear effect of `time` and using the covariate of interest as the numeric `by` variable (see `?mgcv::s` or `?brms::gp` for more details). The `dynamic()` formula wrapper offers a way to automate this process, and will eventually allow for a broader variety of time-varying effects (such as random walk or AR processes). Depending on the arguments that are specified to `dynamic`, it will either set up a low-rank GP smooth function using `s()` with `bs = 'gp'` and a fixed value of the length scale parameter $\rho$, or it will set up a Hilbert space approximate GP using the `gp()` function with `c=5/4` so that $\rho$ is estimated (see `?dynamic` for more details). In this first example we will use the `s()` option, and will mis-specify the $\rho$ parameter here as, in practice, it is never known. This call to `dynamic()` will set up the following smooth: `s(time, by = temp, bs = "gp", m = c(-2, 8, 2), k = 40)`
```{r, include=FALSE}
mod <- mvgam(out ~ dynamic(temp, rho = 8, stationary = TRUE, k = 40),
             family = gaussian(),
             data = data_train,
             silent = 2)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mod <- mvgam(out ~ dynamic(temp, rho = 8, stationary = TRUE, k = 40),
             family = gaussian(),
             data = data_train,
             silent = 2)
```

Inspect the model summary, which shows how the `dynamic()` wrapper was used to construct a low-rank Gaussian Process smooth function:
```{r}
summary(mod, include_betas = FALSE)
```

Because this model used a spline with a `gp` basis, it's smooths can be visualised just like any other `gam`. We can plot the estimates for the in-sample and out-of-sample periods to see how the Gaussian Process function produces sensible smooth forecasts. Here we supply the full dataset to the `newdata` argument in `plot_mvgam_smooth` to inspect posterior forecasts of the time-varying smooth function. Overlay the true simulated function to see that the model has adequately estimated it's dynamics in both the training and testing data partitions
```{r}
plot_mvgam_smooth(mod, smooth = 1, newdata = data)
abline(v = 190, lty = 'dashed', lwd = 2)
lines(beta_temp, lwd = 2.5, col = 'white')
lines(beta_temp, lwd = 2)
```

We can also use `plot_predictions` from the `marginaleffects` package to visualise the time-varying coefficient for what the effect would be estimated to be at different values of $temperature$:
```{r}
require(marginaleffects)
range_round = function(x){
  round(range(x, na.rm = TRUE), 2)
}
plot_predictions(mod, 
                 newdata = datagrid(time = unique,
                                    temp = range_round),
                 by = c('time', 'temp', 'temp'),
                 type = 'link')
```

This results in sensible forecasts of the observations as well
```{r}
fc <- forecast(mod, newdata = data_test)
plot(fc)
```

The syntax is very similar if we wish to estimate the parameters of the underlying Gaussian Process, this time using a Hilbert space approximation. We simply omit the `rho` argument in `dynamic` to make this happen. This will set up a call similar to `gp(time, by = 'temp', c = 5/4, k = 40)`.
```{r include=FALSE}
mod <- mvgam(out ~ dynamic(temp, k = 40),
             family = gaussian(),
             data = data_train,
             silent = 2)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
mod <- mvgam(out ~ dynamic(temp, k = 40),
             family = gaussian(),
             data = data_train,
             silent = 2)
```

This model summary now contains estimates for the marginal deviation and length scale parameters of the underlying Gaussian Process function:
```{r}
summary(mod, include_betas = FALSE)
```

Effects for `gp()` terms can also be plotted as smooths:
```{r}
plot_mvgam_smooth(mod, smooth = 1, newdata = data)
abline(v = 190, lty = 'dashed', lwd = 2)
lines(beta_temp, lwd = 2.5, col = 'white')
lines(beta_temp, lwd = 2)
```

## Salmon survival example
Here we will use openly available data on marine survival of Chinook salmon to illustrate how time-varying effects can be used to improve ecological time series models. [Scheuerell and Williams (2005)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2419.2005.00346.x) used a dynamic linear model to examine the relationship between marine survival of Chinook salmon and an index of ocean upwelling strength along the west coast of the USA. The authors hypothesized that stronger upwelling in April should create better growing conditions for phytoplankton, which would then translate into more zooplankton and provide better foraging opportunities for juvenile salmon entering the ocean. The data on survival is measured as a proportional variable over 42 years (1964–2005) and is available in the `MARSS` package:
```{r}
load(url('https://github.com/atsa-es/MARSS/raw/master/data/SalmonSurvCUI.rda'))
dplyr::glimpse(SalmonSurvCUI)
```

First we need to prepare the data for modelling. The variable `CUI.apr` will be standardized to make it easier for the sampler to estimate underlying GP parameters for the time-varying effect. We also need to convert the survival back to a proportion, as in its current form it has been logit-transformed (this is because most time series packages cannot handle proportional data). As usual, we also need to create a `time` indicator and a `series` indicator for working in `mvgam`:
```{r}
SalmonSurvCUI %>%
  # create a time variable
  dplyr::mutate(time = dplyr::row_number()) %>%

  # create a series variable
  dplyr::mutate(series = as.factor('salmon')) %>%

  # z-score the covariate CUI.apr
  dplyr::mutate(CUI.apr = as.vector(scale(CUI.apr))) %>%

  # convert logit-transformed survival back to proportional
  dplyr::mutate(survival = plogis(logit.s)) -> model_data
```

Inspect the data
```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(model_data)
```

Plot features of the outcome variable, which shows that it is a proportional variable with particular restrictions that we want to model:
```{r}
plot_mvgam_series(data = model_data, y = 'survival')
```


### A State-Space Beta regression
`mvgam` can easily handle data that are bounded at 0 and 1 with a Beta observation model (using the `mgcv` function `betar()`, see `?mgcv::betar` for details).  First we will fit a simple State-Space model that uses an AR1 dynamic process model with no predictors and a Beta observation model:
```{r include = FALSE}
mod0 <- mvgam(formula = survival ~ 1,
             trend_model = AR(),
             noncentred = TRUE,
             priors = prior(normal(-3.5, 0.5), class = Intercept),
             family = betar(),
             data = model_data,
             silent = 2)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
mod0 <- mvgam(formula = survival ~ 1,
              trend_model = AR(),
              noncentred = TRUE,
              priors = prior(normal(-3.5, 0.5), class = Intercept),
              family = betar(),
              data = model_data,
              silent = 2)
```

The summary of this model shows good behaviour of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler and provides useful summaries on the Beta observation model parameters:
```{r}
summary(mod0)
```

A plot of the underlying dynamic component shows how it has easily handled the temporal evolution of the time series:
```{r}
plot(mod0, type = 'trend')
```

### Including time-varying upwelling effects
Now we can increase the complexity of our model by constructing and fitting a State-Space model with a time-varying effect of the coastal upwelling index in addition to the autoregressive dynamics. We again use a Beta observation model to capture the restrictions of our proportional observations, but this time will include a `dynamic()` effect of `CUI.apr` in the latent process model. We do not specify the $\rho$ parameter, instead opting to estimate it using a Hilbert space approximate GP:
```{r include=FALSE}
mod1 <- mvgam(formula = survival ~ 1,
              trend_formula = ~ dynamic(CUI.apr, k = 25, scale = FALSE) - 1,
              trend_model = AR(),
              noncentred = TRUE,
              priors = prior(normal(-3.5, 0.5), class = Intercept),
              family = betar(),
              data = model_data,
              adapt_delta = 0.99,
              silent = 2)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
mod1 <- mvgam(formula = survival ~ 1,
              trend_formula = ~ dynamic(CUI.apr, k = 25, scale = FALSE) - 1,
              trend_model = AR(),
              noncentred = TRUE,
              priors = prior(normal(-3.5, 0.5), class = Intercept),
              family = betar(),
              data = model_data,
              silent = 2)
```

The summary for this model now includes estimates for the time-varying GP parameters:
```{r}
summary(mod1, include_betas = FALSE)
```

The estimates for the underlying dynamic process, and for the hindcasts, haven't changed much:
```{r}
plot(mod1, type = 'trend')
```

```{r}
plot(mod1, type = 'forecast')
```

But the process error parameter $\sigma$ is slightly smaller for this model than for the first model:
```{r}
# Extract estimates of the process error 'sigma' for each model
mod0_sigma <- as.data.frame(mod0, variable = 'sigma', regex = TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(model = 'Mod0')
mod1_sigma <- as.data.frame(mod1, variable = 'sigma', regex = TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(model = 'Mod1')
sigmas <- rbind(mod0_sigma, mod1_sigma)

# Plot using ggplot2
require(ggplot2)
ggplot(sigmas, aes(y = `sigma[1]`, fill = model)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3, colour = NA) +
  coord_flip()
```

Why does the process error not need to be as flexible in the second model? Because the estimates of this dynamic process are now informed partly by the time-varying effect of upwelling, which we can visualise on the link scale using `plot()`:
```{r}
plot(mod1, type = 'smooths', trend_effects = TRUE)
```

### Comparing model predictive performances
A key question when fitting multiple time series models is whether one of them provides better predictions than the other. There are several options in `mvgam` for exploring this quantitatively. First, we can compare models based on in-sample approximate leave-one-out cross-validation as implemented in the popular `loo` package:
```{r}
loo_compare(mod0, mod1)
```

The second model has the larger Expected Log Predictive Density (ELPD), meaning that it is slightly favoured over the simpler model that did not include the time-varying upwelling effect. However, the two models certainly do not differ by much. But this metric only compares in-sample performance, and we are hoping to use our models to produce reasonable forecasts. Luckily, `mvgam` also has routines for comparing models using approximate leave-future-out cross-validation. Here we refit both models to a reduced training set (starting at time point 30) and produce approximate 1-step ahead forecasts. These forecasts are used to estimate forecast ELPD before expanding the training set one time point at a time. We use Pareto-smoothed importance sampling to reweight posterior predictions, acting as a kind of particle filter so that we don't need to refit the model too often (you can read more about how this process works in Bürkner et al. 2020).
```{r include=FALSE}
lfo_mod0 <- lfo_cv(mod0, min_t = 30)
lfo_mod1 <- lfo_cv(mod1, min_t = 30)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
lfo_mod0 <- lfo_cv(mod0, min_t = 30)
lfo_mod1 <- lfo_cv(mod1, min_t = 30)
```

The model with the time-varying upwelling effect tends to provides better 1-step ahead forecasts, with a higher total forecast ELPD
```{r}
sum(lfo_mod0$elpds)
sum(lfo_mod1$elpds)
```

We can also plot the ELPDs for each model as a contrast. Here, values less than zero suggest the time-varying predictor model (Mod1) gives better 1-step ahead forecasts:
```{r, fig.alt = "Comparing forecast skill for dynamic beta regression models in mvgam and R"}
plot(x = 1:length(lfo_mod0$elpds) + 30,
     y = lfo_mod0$elpds - lfo_mod1$elpds,
     ylab = 'ELPDmod0 - ELPDmod1',
     xlab = 'Evaluation time point',
     pch = 16,
     col = 'darkred',
     bty = 'l')
abline(h = 0, lty = 'dashed')
```

A useful exercise to further expand this model would be to think about what kinds of predictors might impact measurement error, which could easily be implemented into the observation formula in `mvgam()`. But for now, we will leave the model as-is.
