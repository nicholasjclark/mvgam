\description{
Complete brms ecosystem integration and validation for mvgam models.
This file consolidates brms setup, formula validation, multivariate
parsing, and nonlinear model support.

\section{Architecture}{

The brms integration system provides seamless compatibility:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Setup Layer}: Lightweight brms model setup for rapid prototyping
\item \strong{Validation Layer}: Comprehensive formula validation and syntax checking
\item \strong{Parsing Layer}: Multivariate and nonlinear formula interpretation
\item \strong{Extension Layer}: Enhanced functionality beyond base brms capabilities
}
