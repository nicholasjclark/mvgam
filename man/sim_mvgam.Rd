\arguments{
\item{T}{\code{integer}. Number of observations (timepoints)}

\item{n_series}{\code{integer}. Number of discrete time series}

\item{seasonality}{\code{character}. Either \code{shared}, meaning that all series share the exact same seasonal pattern,
or \code{hierarchical}, meaning that there is a global seasonality but each series' pattern can deviate slightly}

\item{use_lv}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, use dynamic factors to estimate series'
latent trends in a reduced dimension format. If \code{FALSE}, estimate independent latent trends for each series}

\item{n_lv}{\code{integer}. Number of latent dynamic factors for generating the series' trends.
Defaults to \code{0}, meaning that dynamics are estimated independently for each series}

\item{trend_model}{\code{character} specifying the time series dynamics for the latent trend. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{None} (no latent trend component; i.e. the GAM component is all that contributes to the linear predictor,
and the observation process is the only source of error; similarly to what is estimated by \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}})
\item \code{RW} (random walk with possible drift)
\item \code{AR1} (with possible drift)
\item \code{AR2} (with possible drift)
\item \code{AR3} (with possible drift)
\item \code{VAR1} (contemporaneously uncorrelated VAR1)
\item \code{VAR1cor} (contemporaneously correlated VAR1)
\item \code{GP} (Gaussian Process with squared exponential kernel)} See \link{mvgam_trends} for more details}

\item{drift}{\code{logical}, simulate a drift term for each trend}

\item{prop_trend}{\code{numeric}. Relative importance of the trend for each series. Should be between \code{0} and \code{1}}

\item{trend_rel}{Deprecated. Use \code{prop_trend} instead}

\item{freq}{\code{integer}. The seasonal frequency of the series}

\item{family}{\code{family} specifying the exponential observation family for the series. Currently supported
families are: \code{nb()}, \code{poisson()}, \code{bernoulli()}, \code{tweedie()}, \code{gaussian()},
\code{betar()}, \code{lognormal()}, \code{student()} and \code{Gamma()}}

\item{phi}{\code{vector} of dispersion parameters for the series
(i.e. \code{size} for \code{nb()} or
\code{phi} for \code{betar()}). If \code{length(phi) < n_series},
the first element of \code{phi} will
be replicated \code{n_series} times.
Defaults to \code{5} for \code{nb()} and \code{tweedie()}; \code{10} for
\code{betar()}}

\item{shape}{\code{vector} of shape parameters for the series
(i.e. \code{shape} for \code{gamma()})
If \code{length(shape) < n_series}, the first element of \code{shape} will
be replicated \code{n_series} times. Defaults to \code{10}}

\item{sigma}{\code{vector} of scale parameters for the series
(i.e. \code{sd} for \code{gaussian()} or \code{student()},
\code{log(sd)} for \code{lognormal()}). If \code{length(sigma) < n_series}, the first element of \code{sigma} will
be replicated \code{n_series} times. Defaults to \code{0.5} for \code{gaussian()} and
\code{student()}; \code{0.2} for \code{lognormal()}}

\item{nu}{\code{vector} of degrees of freedom parameters for the
series (i.e. \code{nu} for \code{student()})
If \code{length(nu) < n_series}, the first element of \code{nu} will
be replicated \code{n_series} times. Defaults to \code{3}}

\item{mu}{\code{vector} of location parameters for the series. If \code{length(mu) < n_series}, the first element of \code{mu} will
be replicated \code{n_series} times. Defaults to small random values between \code{-0.5} and \code{0.5} on the link scale}

\item{prop_missing}{\code{numeric} stating proportion of observations that are missing. Should be between
\code{0} and \code{0.8}, inclusive}

\item{prop_train}{\code{numeric} stating the proportion of data to use for training. Should be between \code{0.2} and \code{1}}
}
\value{
A \code{list} object containing outputs needed for \code{\link{mvgam}}, including 'data_train' and 'data_test',
as well as some additional information about the simulated seasonality and trend dependencies
}
\description{
This function simulates sets of time series data for fitting a multivariate GAM that includes
shared seasonality and dependence on state-space latent dynamic factors. Random dependencies among series, i.e.
correlations in their long-term trends, are included in the form of correlated loadings on the latent dynamic factors
}
\examples{
# Simulate series with observations bounded at 0 and 1 (Beta responses)
sim_data <- sim_mvgam(family = betar(), trend_model = RW(), prop_trend = 0.6)
plot_mvgam_series(data = sim_data$data_train, series = 'all')

# Now simulate series with overdispersed discrete observations
sim_data <- sim_mvgam(family = nb(), trend_model = RW(), prop_trend = 0.6, phi = 10)
plot_mvgam_series(data = sim_data$data_train, series = 'all')
