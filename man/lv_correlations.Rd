\title{Calculate trend correlations based on latent factor loadings for \pkg{mvgam} models}
\usage{
lv_correlations(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object of class \code{mvgam}}
}
\value{
A \code{list} object containing the mean posterior correlations
and the full array of posterior correlations
}
\description{
This function uses samples of latent trends for each series from a fitted
mvgam model to calculates correlations among series' trends
}
\details{
Although this function will still work, it is now recommended to use
\code{\link[=residual_cor]{residual_cor()}} for to obtain residual correlation information in a more user-friendly
format that allows for a deeper investigation of relationships among the time series.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# Fit a model that uses two AR(1) dynamic factors to model
# the temporal dynamics of the four rodent species in the portal_data
mod <- mvgam(captures ~ series,
            trend_model = AR(),
            use_lv = TRUE,
            n_lv = 2,
            data = portal_data,
            chains = 2,
            silent = 2)

# Calculate correlations among the series using lv_correlations()
lvcors <- lv_correlations(mod)
names(lvcors)
lapply(lvcors, class)

# The above works, but it is now recommended to use the more
# flexible and informative residual_cor() function to
# calculate and work with these correlations
lvcors <- residual_cor(mod)
names(lvcors)
lvcors$cor

# For those correlations whose credible intervals did not include
# zero, plot them as a correlation matrix (all other correlations
# are shown as zero on this plot)
plot(lvcors, cluster = TRUE)
