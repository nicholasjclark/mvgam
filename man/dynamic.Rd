\usage{
dynamic(variable, k, rho = 5, stationary = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable}{The variable that the dynamic smooth will be a function of}

\item{k}{Optional number of basis functions for computing approximate GPs. If missing,
\code{k} will be set as large as possible to accurately estimate the nonlinear function}

\item{rho}{Either a positive numeric stating the length scale to be used for approximating the
squared exponential Gaussian Process smooth (see \code{\link[mgcv]{gp.smooth}} for details)
or missing, in which case the length scale will be estimated by setting up a Hilbert space approximate
GP}

\item{stationary}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (the default) and \code{rho} is supplied,
the latent Gaussian Process smooth will not have a linear trend component. If \code{FALSE},
a linear trend in the covariate is added to the Gaussian Process smooth. Leave at \code{TRUE}
if you do not believe the coefficient is evolving with much trend, as the linear component of the
basis functions can be hard to penalize to zero. This sometimes causes divergence issues in \code{Stan}.
See \code{\link[mgcv]{gp.smooth}} for details. Ignored if \code{rho} is missing (in which case a
Hilbert space approximate GP is used)}

\item{scale}{Logical; If \code{TRUE} (the default) and \code{rho} is missing, predictors
are scaled so that the maximum Euclidean distance between two points is \code{1}. This
often improves sampling speed and convergence. Scaling also affects the estimated
length-scale parameters in that they resemble those of scaled predictors
(not of the original predictors) if scale is \code{TRUE}.}

\description{
Set up time-varying (dynamic) coefficients for use in mvgam models. Currently, only
low-rank Gaussian Process smooths are available for estimating the dynamics of the
time-varying coefficient.
}
\details{
\code{mvgam} currently sets up dynamic coefficients as low-rank
squared exponential Gaussian Process smooths via
the call \code{s(time, by = variable, bs = "gp", m = c(2, rho, 2))}. These smooths, if specified with
reasonable values for the length scale parameter, will give more realistic out of sample forecasts
than standard splines such as thin plate or cubic. But the user must set the
value for \code{rho}, as there is currently no support for estimating this value in \code{mgcv}.
This may not be too big of a problem, as estimating latent length scales is often difficult anyway. The
\code{rho} parameter should be thought of as a prior on the smoothness of the latent dynamic coefficient
function (where higher values of \code{rho} lead to smoother functions with more temporal covariance structure.
Values of \code{k} are
set automatically to ensure enough basis functions are used to approximate the expected
wiggliness of the underlying dynamic function (\code{k} will increase as \code{rho} decreases)
