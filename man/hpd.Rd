\title{This function uses estimated densities to calculate HPD intevals. Code originally supplied by Martyn Plummer}
\usage{
hpd(x, coverage = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{vector} of values representing the distribution to be summarised}

\item{coverage}{\code{numeric} value specifying the width of the HPD interval. Default is 0.95}
}
\value{
A \code{list} containing the reconciled forecast distributions for each series in \code{y}. Each element in
the \code{vector} with three values: lower estimate, median estimate and upper estimate of the HPD interval
