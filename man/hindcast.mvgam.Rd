\title{Extract hindcasts for a fitted \code{mvgam} object}
\usage{
hindcast(object, ...)

\method{hindcast}{mvgam}(object, type = "response", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object of class \code{mvgam} or \code{jsdgam}. See \code{\link[=mvgam]{mvgam()}}}

\item{...}{Ignored}

\item{type}{When this has the value \code{link} (default) the linear predictor is
calculated on the link scale.
If \code{expected} is used, predictions reflect the expectation of the response (the mean)
but ignore uncertainty in the observation process. When \code{response} is used,
the predictions take uncertainty in the observation process into account to return
predictions on the outcome scale. When \code{variance} is used, the variance of the response
with respect to the mean (mean-variance relationship) is returned.
When \code{type = "terms"}, each component of the linear predictor is
returned separately in the form of a \code{list} (possibly with standard
errors, if \code{summary = TRUE}): this includes parametric model components,
followed by each smooth component, but excludes any offset and any intercept.
Two special cases are also allowed:
type \code{latent_N} will return the estimated latent abundances from an
N-mixture distribution, while type \code{detection} will return the estimated
detection probability from an N-mixture distribution}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{mvgam_forecast} containing hindcast distributions.
See \code{\link{mvgam_forecast-class}} for details.

Posterior retrodictions are drawn from the fitted \code{mvgam} and
organized into a convenient format
