\title{Fitted \code{mvgam} object description}
\description{
A fitted \code{mvgam} object returned by function \code{\link{mvgam}}.
Method functions \code{code}, \code{coef}, \code{forecast}, \code{hindcast}, \code{lfo_cv},
\code{logLik}, \code{plot}, \code{ppc}, \code{predict},
\code{print}, \code{score}, \code{summary} and \code{update} exist for this class.
}
\details{
A \code{mvgam} object contains the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{call} the original model formula
\item \code{family} \code{character} description of the observation distribution
\item \code{trend_model} \code{character} description of the latent trend model
\item \code{drift} Logical specifying whether a drift term was used in the trend model
\item \code{priors} If the model priors were updated from their defaults, the prior \code{dataframe}
will be returned. Otherwise \code{NULL}
\item \code{model_output} The \code{MCMC} object returned by the fitting engine. If the model was fitted
using \code{Stan}, this will be an object of class \code{stanfit} (see \code{\link[rstan]{stanfit-class}} for details).
If \code{JAGS} was used as the backend, this will be an object of class \code{runjags}
(see \code{\link[runjags]{runjags-class}} for details)
\item \code{model_file} The \code{character} string model file used to describe the model in either
\code{Stan} or \code{JAGS} syntax
\item \code{model_data} If \code{return_model_data} was set to \code{TRUE} when fitting the model, the \code{list} object
containing all data objects needed to condition the model is returned. Each item in the \code{list} is described
in detail at the top of the \code{model_file}. Otherwise \code{NULL}
\item \code{inits} If \code{return_model_data} was set to \code{TRUE} when fitting the model, the initial value
functions used to initialise the MCMC chains will be returned. Otherwise \code{NULL}
\item \code{monitor_pars} If \code{return_model_data} was set to \code{TRUE} when fitting the model, the parameters
that were monitored during MCMC sampling are returned as a \verb{character vector}. Otherwise \code{NULL}
\item \code{sp_names} A \verb{character vector} specifying the names for each smoothing parameter
\item \code{mgcv_model} An object of class \code{gam} containing the \code{mgcv} version of the observation model.
This object is used for generating the linear predictor matrix when making predictions for new data. The
coefficients in this model object will contain the posterior median coefficients from the GAM linear predictor,
but these are only used if generating plots of smooth functions that \code{mvgam} currently cannot handle
(such as plots for three-dimensional smooths). This model therefore should not be used for inference.
See \code{\link[mgcv]{gamObject}} for details.
\item \code{ytimes} The \code{matrix} object used in model fitting for indexing which series and timepoints
were observed in each row of the supplied data. Used internally by some downstream plotting
and prediction functions
\item \code{resids} A named \code{list} object containing posterior draws of Dunn-Smyth
randomized quantile residuals
\item \code{use_lv} Logical flag indicating whether latent dynamic factors were used in the model
\item \code{n_lv} If \code{use_lv == TRUE}, the number of latent dynamic factors used in the model
\item \code{upper_bounds} If bounds were supplied in the original model fit, they will be returned.
Otherwise \code{NULL}
\item \code{obs_data} The original data object (either a \code{list} or \code{dataframe}) supplied in model
fitting.
\item \code{test_data} If test data were supplied (as argument \code{newdata} in the original model), it
will be returned. Othwerise \code{NULL}
\item \code{fit_engine} \code{Character} describing the fit engine, either as \code{stan} or \code{jags}
\item \code{max_treedepth} If the model was fitted using \code{Stan}, the value supplied for the maximum
treedepth tuning parameter is returned (see \code{\link[rstan]{stan}} for details).
Otherwise \code{NULL}
\item \code{adapt_delta} If the model was fitted using \code{Stan}, the value supplied for the adapt_delta
tuning parameter is returned (see \code{\link[rstan]{stan}} for details).
Otherwise \code{NULL}
