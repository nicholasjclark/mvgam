\value{
An object of class \code{mvgam_trend}, which contains a list of
arguments to be interpreted by the parsing functions in \code{mvgam}
}
\description{
Set up low-rank approximate Gaussian Process trend models using Hilbert
basis expansions in \code{mvgam}. This function does not evaluate its arguments –
it exists purely to help set up a model with particular GP
trend models.
}
\details{
A GP trend is estimated for each series using
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11408}{Hilbert space approximate Gaussian Processes}.
In \code{mvgam}, latent squared exponential GP trends are approximated using by
default \code{20} basis functions and using a multiplicative factor of \code{c = 5/4},
which saves computational costs compared to fitting full GPs while adequately estimating
GP \code{alpha} and \code{rho} parameters.
