\usage{
GP(...)

\value{
An object of class \code{mvgam_trend}, which contains a list of
arguments to be interpreted by the parsing functions in \pkg{mvgam}.
}
\description{
Set up low-rank approximate Gaussian Process trend models using Hilbert
basis expansions in \pkg{mvgam}. This function does not evaluate its
arguments – it exists purely to help set up a model with particular GP
trend models.
}
\details{
A GP trend is estimated for each series using Hilbert space
approximate Gaussian Processes. In \code{mvgam}, latent squared exponential GP
trends are approximated using by default \code{20} basis functions and
using a multiplicative factor of \code{c = 5/4}, which saves computational
costs compared to fitting full GPs while adequately estimating GP
\code{alpha} and \code{rho} parameters.
