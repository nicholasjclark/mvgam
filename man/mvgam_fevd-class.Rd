\details{
A forecast error variance decomposition is useful for quantifying the amount
of information each series that in a Vector Autoregression contributes to the forecast
distributions of the other series in the autoregression. This object contains
the forecast error variance decomposition using the
orthogonalised impulse response coefficient matrices \eqn{\Psi_h}, which can be used to
quantify the contribution of series \eqn{j} to the
h-step forecast error variance of series \eqn{k}:
\deqn{
\sigma_k^2(h) = \sum_{j=1}^K(\psi_{kj, 0}^2 + \ldots + \psi_{kj,
h-1}^2) \quad
}
If the orthogonalised impulse reponses \eqn{(\psi_{kj, 0}^2 + \ldots + \psi_{kj, h-1}^2)}
are divided by the variance of the forecast error \eqn{\sigma_k^2(h)},
this yields an interpretable percentage representing how much of the
forecast error variance for \eqn{k} can be explained by an exogenous shock to \eqn{j}.
This percentage is what is calculated and returned in objects of class \code{mvgam_fevd},
where the posterior distribution of variance decompositions for each variable in the
original model is contained in a separate slot within the returned \code{list} object
