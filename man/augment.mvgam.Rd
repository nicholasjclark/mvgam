\title{Augment an \pkg{mvgam} object's data}
\usage{
\method{augment}{mvgam}(x, robust = FALSE, probs = c(0.025, 0.975), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{mvgam}.}

\item{robust}{If \code{FALSE} (the default) the mean is used as the measure of
central tendency and the standard deviation as the measure of variability.
If \code{TRUE}, the median and the median absolute deviation (MAD)
are applied instead.}

\item{probs}{The percentiles to be computed by the quantile function.}

\item{...}{Unused, included for generic consistency only.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} or \code{tibble} (see details) combining:
\itemize{
\item The data supplied to \code{mvgam()}.
\item The outcome variable, named as \code{.observed}.
\item The fitted backcasts, along with their variability and credible bounds.
\item The residuals, along with their variability and credible bounds.
}
}
\description{
Add fits and residuals to the data, implementing the generic \code{augment} from
the package \pkg{broom}.
}
\details{
A \code{list} is returned if \code{class(x$obs_data) == 'list'}, otherwise a \code{tibble} is
returned, but the contents of either object is the same.

The arguments \code{robust} and \code{probs} are applied to both the fit and
residuals calls (see \code{\link[=fitted.mvgam]{fitted.mvgam()}} and \code{\link[=residuals.mvgam]{residuals.mvgam()}} for details).
