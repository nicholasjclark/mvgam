Supported mvgam trend models
}
\details{
\code{mvgam} currently supports the following dynamic trend models:
\itemize{
\item \code{None} (no latent trend component; i.e. the GAM component is all that contributes to the linear predictor,
and the observation process is the only source of error; similarly to what is estimated by \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}})
\item \code{ZMVN()} (zero-mean correlated errors, useful for modelling time series where no
autoregressive terms are needed or for modelling data that are not sampled as time series)
\item \code{RW()}
\item \verb{AR(p = 1, 2, or 3)}
\item \code{CAR(p = 1)}(continuous time autoregressive trends; only available in \code{Stan})
\item \code{VAR()}(only available in \code{Stan})
\item \code{PW()} (piecewise linear or logistic trends; only available in \code{Stan})
\item \code{GP()} (Gaussian Process with squared exponential kernel;
only available in \code{Stan})}

For most dynamic trend types available in \code{mvgam} (see argument \code{trend_model}), time should be
measured in discrete, regularly spaced intervals (i.e. \code{c(1, 2, 3, ...)}). However you can
use irregularly spaced intervals if using \code{trend_model = CAR(1)}, though note that any
temporal intervals that are exactly \code{0} will be adjusted to a very small number
(\code{1e-12}) to prevent sampling errors. For all autoregressive trend types
apart from \code{CAR()}, moving average and/or correlated
process error terms can also be estimated (for example, \code{RW(cor = TRUE)} will set up a
multivariate Random Walk if \code{data} contains \verb{>1} series). Hierarchical process error correlations
can also be handled if the data contain relevant observation units that are nested into
relevant grouping and subgrouping levels (i.e. using \code{AR(gr = region, subgr = species)})

Note that only \code{RW}, \code{AR1}, \code{AR2} and \code{AR3} are available if
using \code{JAGS}. All trend models are supported if using \code{Stan}.
Dynamic factor models can be used in which the latent factors evolve as either
\code{RW}, \code{AR1-3}, \code{VAR} or \code{GP}. For \code{VAR} models
(i.e. \code{VAR} and \code{VARcor} models), users can either fix the trend error covariances to be \code{0}
(using \code{VAR}) or estimate them and potentially allow for contemporaneously correlated errors using
\code{VARcor}. For all \code{VAR} models, stationarity of
the latent process is enforced through the prior using the parameterisation given by
Heaps (2022). Stationarity is not enforced when using \code{AR1}, \code{AR2} or \code{AR3} models,
though this can be changed by the user by specifying lower and upper bounds on autoregressive
parameters using functionality in \link{get_mvgam_priors} and the \code{priors} argument in
\link{mvgam}. Piecewise trends follow the formulation in the popular \code{prophet} package produced
by \code{Facebook}, where users can allow for changepoints to control the potential flexibility
of the trend. See Taylor and Letham (2018) for details
