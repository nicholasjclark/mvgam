\description{
Compute reactivity, return rates and contributions of interactions to
stationary forecast variance from
\code{mvgam} models with Vector Autoregressive dynamics
}
\details{
These measures of stability can be used to assess how important inter-series
dependencies are to the variability of a multivariate system and to ask how systems
are expected to respond to environmental perturbations. Using the formula for a latent VAR(1) as:
\deqn{
\mu_t \sim \text{MVNormal}(A(\mu_{t - 1}), \Sigma) \quad
}
this function will calculate the long-term stationary forecast distribution of the system, which
has mean \eqn{\mu_{\infty}} and variance \eqn{\Sigma_{\infty}}, to then calculate the following quantities:
\itemize{
\item \code{prop_int}: Proportion of the volume of the stationary forecast distribution
that is attributable to lagged interactions (i.e. how important are the autoregressive
interaction coefficients in \eqn{A} for explaining the shape of the stationary forecast distribution?):
\deqn{
    det(A)^2 \quad
    }
\item \code{prop_int_adj}: Same as \code{prop_int} but scaled by the number of series \eqn{p} to facilitate
direct comparisons among systems with different numbers of interacting variables:
\deqn{
    det(A)^{2/p} \quad
    }
\item \code{prop_int_offdiag}: Sensitivity of \code{prop_int} to inter-series
interactions (i.e. how important are the off-diagonals of the autoregressive coefficient
matrix \eqn{A} for shaping \code{prop_int}?), calculated as the relative magnitude of the \emph{off-diagonals} in
the partial derivative matrix:
\deqn{
    [2~det(A) (A^{-1})^T] \quad
    }
\item \code{prop_int_diag}: Sensitivity of \code{prop_int} to intra-series
interactions (i.e. how important are the diagonals of the autoregressive coefficient matrix \eqn{A}
for shaping \code{prop_int}?), calculated as the relative magnitude of the \emph{diagonals} in the partial derivative
matrix:
\deqn{
    [2~det(A) (A^{-1})^T] \quad
    }
\item \code{prop_cov_offdiag}: Sensitivity of \eqn{\Sigma_{\infty}} to inter-series error correlations
(i.e. how important are off-diagonal covariances in \eqn{\Sigma} for shaping
\eqn{\Sigma_{\infty}}?), calculated as the relative magnitude of the \emph{off-diagonals} in
the partial derivative matrix:
\deqn{
    [2~det(\Sigma_{\infty}) (\Sigma_{\infty}^{-1})^T] \quad
    }
\item \code{prop_cov_diag}: Sensitivity of \eqn{\Sigma_{\infty}} to error variances
(i.e. how important are diagonal variances in \eqn{\Sigma} for shaping
\eqn{\Sigma_{\infty}}?), calculated as the relative magnitude of the \emph{diagonals} in
the partial derivative matrix:
\deqn{
    [2~det(\Sigma_{\infty}) (\Sigma_{\infty}^{-1})^T] \quad
    }
\item \code{reactivity}: A measure of the degree to which the system moves
away from a stable equilibrium following a perturbation.
Values \verb{> 0} suggest the system is reactive, whereby a
perturbation of the system in one period can be amplified in the next period. If
\eqn{\sigma_{max}(A)} is the largest singular value of \eqn{A}, then reactivity is defined as:
\deqn{
    log\sigma_{max}(A) \quad
    }
\item \code{mean_return_rate}: Asymptotic (long-term) return rate of the mean of the transition distribution
to the stationary mean, calculated using the largest eigenvalue of the matrix \eqn{A}:
\deqn{
   max(\lambda_{A}) \quad
   }
Lower values suggest greater stability
\item \code{var_return_rate}: Asymptotic (long-term) return rate of the variance of the transition distribution
to the stationary variance:
\deqn{
   max(\lambda_{A \otimes{A}}) \quad
   }
Again, lower values suggest greater stability
}
Major advantages of using \pkg{mvgam} to compute these metrics are that well-calibrated uncertainties are
available and that VAR processes are forced to be stationary. These properties make it simple and
insightful to calculate and inspect aspects of both long-term and short-term stability.
But it is also possible to more directly inspect possible interactions among the
time series in a latent VAR process. To do so, you can calculate and plot
Generalized or Orthogonalized Impulse Response Functions using the \code{\link{irf}} function.
