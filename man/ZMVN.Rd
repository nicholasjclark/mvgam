\title{Specify correlated residual processes in \pkg{mvgam}}
\usage{
ZMVN(time = NA, series = NA, gr = NA, subgr = NA, n_lv = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{An optional grouping variable, which must be a \code{factor} in the
supplied \code{data}, for setting up hierarchical residual correlation
structures. If specified, this will automatically set up a model where the
residual correlations for a specific level of \code{gr} are modelled
hierarchically:

\eqn{\Omega_{group} = p\Omega_{global} + (1 - p)\Omega_{group, local}},

where \eqn{\Omega_{global}} is a \emph{global} correlation matrix,
\eqn{\Omega_{group, local}} is a \emph{local deviation} correlation matrix, and
\eqn{p} is a weighting parameter controlling how strongly the local
correlation matrix \eqn{\Omega_{group}} is shrunk towards the global
correlation matrix \eqn{\Omega_{global}}. If \code{gr} is supplied then \code{subgr}
\emph{must} also be supplied}

\item{subgr}{A subgrouping \code{factor} variable specifying which element in
\code{data} represents the different observational units. Defaults to \code{series}
to be consistent with other functionalities in \pkg{mvgam}, though note
that the data need not be time series in this case

Models that use the hierarchical correlations (by supplying a value for
\code{gr}) \emph{should not} include a \code{series} element in \code{data}. Rather, this
element will be created internally based on the supplied variables for \code{gr}
and \code{subgr}

For example, if you are modelling counts for a group of species (labelled
as \code{species} in the data) across sampling sites (labelled as \code{site} in the
data) in three different geographical regions (labelled as \code{region}), and
you would like the residuals to be correlated within regions, then you
should specify \code{unit = site}, \code{gr = region}, and \code{subgr = species}

Internally, \code{mvgam()} will appropriately order the data by \code{unit} (in this
case, by \code{site}) and create the \code{series} element for the data using
something like:

\code{series = as.factor(paste0(group, '_', subgroup))}}

\item{unit}{The unquoted name of the variable that represents the unit of
analysis in \code{data} over which latent residuals should be correlated. This
variable should be either a \code{numeric} or \code{integer} variable in the
supplied \code{data}. Defaults to \code{time} to be consistent with other
functionalities in \pkg{mvgam}, though note that the data need not be time
series in this case. See examples below for further details and
explanations}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{mvgam_trend}, which contains a list of
arguments to be interpreted by the parsing functions in \pkg{mvgam}
}
\description{
Set up latent correlated multivariate Gaussian residual processes in
\pkg{mvgam}. This function does not evaluate its arguments – it exists
purely to help set up a model with particular error processes
