\usage{
ordinate(object, ...)

\method{ordinate}{jsdgam}(
  object,
  which_lvs = c(1, 2),
  biplot = TRUE,
  alpha = 0.5,
  label_sites = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object of class \code{jsdgam} resulting from a call to \code{\link[=jsdgam]{jsdgam()}}}

\item{...}{ignored}

\item{which_lvs}{A \code{vector} of indices indicating the two latent variables to be plotted
(if number of the latent variables specified in the model was more than 2).
Defaults to \code{c(1, 2)}}

\item{biplot}{\code{Logical}. If \code{TRUE}, both the site and the species
scores will be plotted, with names for the taxa interpreted based on the \code{species}
argument in the original call to \code{\link[=jsdgam]{jsdgam()}}. If \code{FALSE}, only the site scores
will be plotted}

\item{alpha}{A proportional numeric scalar between \code{0} and \code{1} that controls the relative
scaling of the latent variables and their loading coefficients}

\item{label_sites}{\code{Logical} flag. If \code{TRUE}, site scores will be
plotted as labels using names based on the \code{unit} argument in the original call to \code{\link[=jsdgam]{jsdgam()}}.
If \code{FALSE}, site scores will be shown as points only}
}
\value{
An \code{ggplot} object

\description{
Plot an ordination of latent variables and their factor loadings from
\code{jsdgam} models
}
\details{
This function constructs a two-dimensional scatterplot in ordination space. The
chosen latent variables are first re-rotated using singular value decomposition,
so that the first plotted latent variable does not have to be the first latent variable
that was estimated in the original model. Posterior median estimates of the variables
and the species' loadings on these variables are then used to construct the resulting plot.
Some attempt at de-cluttering the resulting plot is made by using \code{geom_label_repel()} and
\code{geom_text_repel} from the \pkg{ggrepel} package, but if there are many sites and/or species
then some labels may be removed automatically. Note that you can typically get
better, more readable plot layouts if you also have the \pkg{ggarrow} and
\pkg{ggpp} packages installed
