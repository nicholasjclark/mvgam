\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}. See \code{\link[=mvgam]{mvgam()}}}

\item{formula}{Optional new \code{formula} object. Note, \code{mvgam} currently does not support dynamic formula
updates such as removal of specific terms with \code{- term}. When updating, the entire formula needs
to be supplied}

\item{trend_formula}{An optional \code{character} string specifying the GAM process model formula. If
supplied, a linear predictor will be modelled for the latent trends to capture process model evolution
separately from the observation model. Should not have a response variable specified on the left-hand side
of the formula (i.e. a valid option would be \code{~ season + s(year)}). Also note that you should not use
the identifier \code{series} in this formula to specify effects that vary across time series. Instead you should use
\code{trend}. This will ensure that models in which a \code{trend_map} is supplied will still work consistently
(i.e. by allowing effects to vary across process models, even when some time series share the same underlying
process model). This feature is only currently available for \code{RW()}, \code{AR()} and \code{VAR()} trend models.
In \code{nmix()} family models, the \code{trend_formula} is used to set up a linear predictor for the underlying
latent abundance. If this is supplied but you do not also supply a \code{trend_map},
the intercept parameter in this formula will automatically be surpressed to maintain identifiability. In other words, the latent process is assumed to be zero-centred}

\item{data}{A \code{dataframe} or \code{list} containing the model response variable and covariates
required by the GAM \code{formula} and optional \code{trend_formula}. Should include columns:
#'\itemize{
\item\code{series} (a \code{factor} index of the series IDs; the number of levels should be identical
to the number of unique series labels (i.e. \code{n_series = length(levels(data$series))}))
\item\code{time} (\code{numeric} or \code{integer} index of the time point for each observation).
For most dynamic trend types available in \code{mvgam} (see argument \code{trend_model}), time should be
measured in discrete, regularly spaced intervals (i.e. \code{c(1, 2, 3, ...)}). However you can
use irregularly spaced intervals if using \code{trend_model = CAR(1)}, though note that any
temporal intervals that are exactly \code{0} will be adjusted to a very small number
(\code{1e-12}) to prevent sampling errors. See an example of \code{CAR()} trends in \code{\link{CAR}}
}
Should also include any other variables to be included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing at least \code{series} and \code{time}
in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}. If included, the
observations in variable \code{y} will be set to \code{NA} when fitting the model so that posterior
simulations can be obtained}

\item{trend_model}{\code{character} or  \code{function} specifying the time series dynamics for the latent trend. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{None} (no latent trend component; i.e. the GAM component is all that contributes to the linear predictor,
and the observation process is the only source of error; similarly to what is estimated by \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}})
\item \code{'RW'} or \code{RW()}
\item \code{'AR1'} or \code{AR(p = 1)}
\item \code{'AR2'} or \code{AR(p = 2)}
\item \code{'AR3'} or \code{AR(p = 3)}
\item \code{'CAR1'} or \code{CAR(p = 1)}
\item \code{'VAR1'}  or \code{VAR()}(only available in \code{Stan})
\item \verb{'PWlogistic}, \code{'PWlinear'} or \code{PW()} (only available in \code{Stan})
\item \code{'GP'} or \code{GP()} (Gaussian Process with squared exponential kernel;
only available in \code{Stan})}

For all trend types apart from \code{GP()}, \code{CAR()} and \code{PW()}, moving average and/or correlated
process error terms can also be estimated (for example, \code{RW(cor = TRUE)} will set up a
multivariate Random Walk if \code{n_series > 1}). See \link{mvgam_trends} for more details}

\item{trend_map}{Optional \code{data.frame} specifying which series should depend on which latent
trends. Useful for allowing multiple series to depend on the same latent trend process, but with
different observation processes. If supplied, a latent factor model is set up by setting
\code{use_lv = TRUE} and using the mapping to set up the shared trends. Needs to have column names
\code{series} and \code{trend}, with integer values in the \code{trend} column to state which trend each series
should depend on. The \code{series} column should have a single unique entry for each series in the
data (names should perfectly match factor levels of the \code{series} variable in \code{data}). Note that
if this is supplied, the intercept parameter in the process model will NOT be automatically suppressed.
See examples for details}

\item{use_lv}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, use dynamic factors to estimate series'
latent trends in a reduced dimension format. Only available for
\code{RW()}, \code{AR()} and \code{GP()} trend models. Defaults to \code{FALSE}}

\item{n_lv}{\code{integer} the number of latent dynamic factors to use if \code{use_lv == TRUE}.
Cannot be \code{> n_series}. Defaults arbitrarily to \code{min(2, floor(n_series / 2))}}

\item{family}{\code{family} specifying the exponential observation family for the series. Currently supported
families are:
\itemize{
\item\code{gaussian()} for real-valued data
\item\code{betar()} for proportional data on \verb{(0,1)}
\item\code{lognormal()} for non-negative real-valued data
\item\code{student_t()} for real-valued data
\item\code{Gamma()} for non-negative real-valued data
\item\code{bernoulli()} for binary data
\item\code{poisson()} for count data
\item\code{nb()} for overdispersed count data
\item\code{binomial()} for count data with imperfect detection when the number of trials is known;
note that the \code{cbind()} function must be used to bind the discrete observations and the discrete number
of trials
\item\code{beta_binomial()} as for \code{binomial()} but allows for overdispersion
\item\code{nmix()} for count data with imperfect detection when the number of trials
is unknown and should be modeled via a State-Space N-Mixture model.
The latent states are Poisson, capturing the 'true' latent
abundance, while the observation process is Binomial to account for
imperfect detection.
See \code{\link{mvgam_families}} for an example of how to use this family}
Note that only \code{nb()} and \code{poisson()} are available if using \code{JAGS} as the backend.
Default is \code{poisson()}.
See \code{\link{mvgam_families}} for more details}

\item{share_obs_params}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE} and the \code{family}
has additional family-specific observation parameters (e.g. variance components in
\code{student_t()} or \code{gaussian()}, or dispersion parameters in \code{nb()} or \code{betar()}),
these parameters will be shared across all series. This is handy if you have multiple
time series that you believe share some properties, such as being from the same
species over different spatial units. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{priors}{An optional \code{data.frame} with prior
definitions (in JAGS or Stan syntax). if using Stan, this can also be an object of
class \code{brmsprior} (see. \code{\link[brms]{prior}} for details). See \link{get_mvgam_priors} and
'Details' for more information on changing default prior distributions}

\item{chains}{\code{integer} specifying the number of parallel chains for the model. Ignored
if \code{algorithm \%in\% c('meanfield', 'fullrank', 'pathfinder', 'laplace')}}

\item{burnin}{\code{integer} specifying the number of warmup iterations of the Markov chain to run
to tune sampling algorithms. Ignored
if \code{algorithm \%in\% c('meanfield', 'fullrank', 'pathfinder', 'laplace')}}

\item{samples}{\code{integer} specifying the number of post-warmup iterations of the Markov chain to run for
sampling the posterior distribution}

\item{threads}{\code{integer} Experimental option to use multithreading for within-chain
parallelisation in \code{Stan}. We recommend its use only if you are experienced with
\code{Stan}'s \code{reduce_sum} function and have a slow running model that cannot be sped
up by any other means. Only available for some families(\code{poisson()}, \code{nb()}, \code{gaussian()}) and
when using \code{Cmdstan} as the backend}

\item{algorithm}{Character string naming the estimation approach to use.
Options are \code{"sampling"} for MCMC (the default), \code{"meanfield"} for
variational inference with factorized normal distributions,
\code{"fullrank"} for variational inference with a multivariate normal
distribution, \code{"laplace"} for a Laplace approximation (only available
when using cmdstanr as the backend) or \code{"pathfinder"} for the pathfinder
algorithm (only currently available when using cmdstanr as the backend).
Can be set globally for the current \R session via the
\code{"brms.algorithm"} option (see \code{\link{options}}). Limited testing
suggests that \code{"meanfield"} performs best out of the non-MCMC approximations for
dynamic GAMs, possibly because of the difficulties estimating covariances among the
many spline parameters and latent trend parameters. But rigorous testing has not
been carried out}

\item{lfo}{Logical indicating whether this is part of a call to \link{lfo_cv.mvgam}. Returns a
lighter version of the model with no residuals and fewer monitored parameters to speed up
post-processing. But other downstream functions will not work properly, so users should always
leave this set as \code{FALSE}}

\item{...}{Other arguments to be passed to \code{\link{mvgam}}}
}
\value{
