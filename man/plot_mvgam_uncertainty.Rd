\usage{
plot_mvgam_uncertainty(
  object,
  series = 1,
  newdata,
  data_test,
  legend_position = "topleft",
  hide_xlabels = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}. See \code{\link[=mvgam]{mvgam()}}}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be plotted}

\item{newdata}{A \code{dataframe} or \code{list} containing at least 'series' and 'time' for the forecast horizon, in
addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}}

\item{data_test}{Deprecated. Still works in place of \code{newdata} but users are recommended to use
\code{newdata} instead for more seamless integration into \code{R} workflows}

\item{legend_position}{The location may also be specified by setting x to a single keyword from the
list: "none", "bottomright", "bottom", "bottomleft", "left", "topleft", "top", "topright", "right" and "center".
This places the legend on the inside of the plot frame at the given location (if it is not "none").}

\item{hide_xlabels}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, no xlabels are printed to allow the user to add custom labels using
\code{axis} from base \code{R}}
}
\value{
A base \code{R} graphics plot
}
\description{
Plot mvgam forecast uncertainty contributions for a specified series
}
\details{
The basic idea of this function is to compute forecasts by ignoring one of the
two primary components in a correlated residual model (i.e. by either ignoring the
linear predictor effects or by ignoring the residual dynamics). Some caution is required
however, as this function was designed early in the \pkg{mvgam} development cycle and
there are now many types of models that it cannot handle very well. For example,
models with shared latent states, or any type of State-Space models that include terms
in the \code{trend_formula}, will either fail or give nonsensical results. Improvements are
in the works to provide a more general way to decompose forecast uncertainties, so
please check back at a later date.
