\description{
Calculate randomized quantile residuals for 'mvgam' objects
}
\details{
For each series, randomized quantile (i.e. Dunn-Smyth) residuals are calculated for inspecting model diagnostics
If the fitted model is appropriate then Dunn-Smyth residuals will be standard normal in distribution and no
autocorrelation will be evident. When a particular observation is missing, the residual is calculated by comparing independent
draws from the model's posterior distribution
