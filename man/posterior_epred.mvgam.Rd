\title{Draws from the Expected Value of the Posterior Predictive Distribution}
\usage{
\method{posterior_epred}{mvgam}(object, newdata, data_test, process_error = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing the
variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}. If not supplied,
predictions are generated for the original observations used for the model fit.}

\item{data_test}{Deprecated. Still works in place of \code{newdata} but users are recommended to use
\code{newdata} instead for more seamless integration into \code{R} workflows}

\item{process_error}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} and \code{newdata} is supplied,
expected uncertainty in the process model is accounted for by using draws
from any latent trend SD parameters. If \code{FALSE}, uncertainty in the latent
trend component is ignored when calculating predictions. If no \code{newdata} is
supplied, draws from the fitted model's posterior predictive distribution will be used
(which will always include uncertainty in any latent trend components)}

\item{...}{Ignored}
}
\value{
A \code{matrix} of dimension \code{n_samples x new_obs},
where \code{n_samples} is the number of posterior samples from the fitted object
and \code{n_obs} is the number of observations in \code{newdata}
}
\description{
Compute posterior draws of the expected value of the posterior predictive
distribution (i.e. the conditional expectation).
Can be performed for the data used to fit the model (posterior
predictive checks) or for new data. By definition, these predictions have
smaller variance than the posterior predictions performed by the
\code{\link{posterior_predict.mvgam}} method. This is because only the
uncertainty in the expected value of the posterior predictive distribution is
incorporated in the draws computed by \code{posterior_epred} while the
residual error is ignored there. However, the estimated means of both methods
averaged across draws should be very similar.
}
\details{
Note that for all types of predictions for models that did not include
a \code{trend_formula}, uncertainty in the dynamic trend
component can be ignored by setting \code{process_error = FALSE}. However,
if a \code{trend_formula} was supplied in the model, predictions for this component cannot be
ignored. If \code{process_error = TRUE}, trend predictions will ignore autocorrelation
coefficients or GP length scale coefficients, ultimately assuming the process is stationary.
This method is similar to the types of posterior predictions returned from \code{brms} models
when using autocorrelated error predictions for newdata.
This function is therefore more suited to posterior simulation from the GAM components
of a \code{mvgam} model, while the forecasting functions
\code{\link{plot_mvgam_fc}} and \code{\link{forecast.mvgam}} are better suited to generate h-step ahead forecasts
that respect the temporal dynamics of estimated latent trends.
