\usage{
\method{predict}{mvgam}(
  object,
  newdata,
  data_test,
  type = "link",
  process_error = TRUE,
  summary = TRUE,
  robust = FALSE,
  probs = c(0.025, 0.975),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}. See \code{\link[=mvgam]{mvgam()}}}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing the
variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}. If not supplied,
predictions are generated for the original observations used for the model fit.}

\item{data_test}{Deprecated. Still works in place of \code{newdata} but users are recommended to use
\code{newdata} instead for more seamless integration into \code{R} workflows}

\item{type}{When this has the value \code{link} (default) the linear predictor is
calculated on the link scale.
If \code{expected} is used, predictions reflect the expectation of the response (the mean)
but ignore uncertainty in the observation process. When \code{response} is used,
the predictions take uncertainty in the observation process into account to return
predictions on the outcome scale. When \code{variance} is used, the variance of the response
with respect to the mean (mean-variance relationship) is returned.
When \code{type = "terms"}, each component of the linear predictor is
returned separately in the form of a \code{list} (possibly with standard
errors, if \code{summary = TRUE}): this includes parametric model components,
followed by each smooth component, but excludes any offset and any intercept.
Two special cases are also allowed:
type \code{latent_N} will return the estimated latent abundances from an
N-mixture distribution, while type \code{detection} will return the estimated
detection probability from an N-mixture distribution}

\item{process_error}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} and a dynamic trend model was fit,
expected uncertainty in the process model is accounted for by using draws
from the latent trend SD parameters. If \code{FALSE}, uncertainty in the latent trend
component is ignored when calculating predictions}

\item{summary}{Should summary statistics be returned
instead of the raw values? Default is \code{TRUE}..}

\item{robust}{If \code{FALSE} (the default) the mean is used as
the measure of central tendency and the standard deviation as
the measure of variability. If \code{TRUE}, the median and the
median absolute deviation (MAD) are applied instead.
Only used if \code{summary} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{probs}{The percentiles to be computed by the \code{quantile}
function. Only used if \code{summary} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Ignored}
}
\value{
Predicted values on the appropriate scale.
If \code{summary = FALSE} and \code{type != "terms"},
the output is a matrix of dimension \verb{n_draw x n_observations}
containing predicted values for each posterior draw in \code{object}.

If \code{summary = TRUE} and \code{type != "terms"}, the output is an \code{n_observations} x \code{E}
matrix. The number of summary statistics \code{E} is equal to \code{2 +
  length(probs)}: The \code{Estimate} column contains point estimates (either
mean or median depending on argument \code{robust}), while the
\code{Est.Error} column contains uncertainty estimates (either standard
deviation or median absolute deviation depending on argument
\code{robust}). The remaining columns starting with \code{Q} contain
quantile estimates as specified via argument \code{probs}.

If \code{type = "terms"} and \code{summary = FALSE}, the output is a named \code{list}
containing a separate slot for each effect, with the effects returned as
matrices of dimension \verb{n_draw x 1}. If \code{summary = TRUE}, the output resembles that
from \code{\link[mgcv]{predict.gam}} when using the call
\code{predict.gam(object, type = "terms", se.fit = TRUE)}, where mean contributions
from each effect are returned in \code{matrix} form while standard errors (representing
the interval: \code{(max(probs) - min(probs)) / 2}) are returned in a separate \code{matrix}

\description{
Predict from the GAM component of an mvgam model
}
\details{
Note that for all types of predictions for models that did not include
a \code{trend_formula}, uncertainty in the dynamic trend
component can be ignored by setting \code{process_error = FALSE}. However,
if a \code{trend_formula} was supplied in the model, predictions for this component cannot be
ignored. If \code{process_error = TRUE}, trend predictions will ignore autocorrelation
coefficients or GP length scale coefficients, ultimately assuming the process is stationary.
This method is similar to the types of posterior predictions returned from \code{brms} models
when using autocorrelated error predictions for newdata.
This function is therefore more suited to posterior simulation from the GAM components
of a \code{mvgam} model, while the forecasting functions
\code{\link{plot_mvgam_fc}} and \code{\link{forecast.mvgam}} are better suited to generate h-step ahead forecasts
that respect the temporal dynamics of estimated latent trends.
