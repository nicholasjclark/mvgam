\usage{
\method{predict}{mvgam}(
  object,
  newdata,
  data_test,
  type = "link",
  process_error = FALSE,
  summary = TRUE,
  robust = FALSE,
  probs = c(0.025, 0.975),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object of class \code{mvgam} or \code{jsdgam}.
See \code{\link[=mvgam]{mvgam()}}}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data
containing the same variables that were included in the original \code{data}
used to fit the model. If not supplied, predictions are generated for the
original observations used for the model fit.}

\item{data_test}{Deprecated. Still works in place of \code{newdata} but
users are recommended to use \code{newdata} instead for more seamless
integration into \code{R} workflows}

\item{type}{When this has the value \code{link} (default) the linear
predictor is calculated on the link scale. If \code{expected} is used,
predictions reflect the expectation of the response (the mean) but ignore
uncertainty in the observation process. When \code{response} is used, the
predictions take uncertainty in the observation process into account to
return predictions on the outcome scale. When \code{variance} is used, the
variance of the response with respect to the mean (mean-variance
relationship) is returned. When \code{type = "terms"}, each component of the
linear predictor is returned separately in the form of a \code{list} (possibly
with standard errors, if \code{summary = TRUE}): this includes parametric model
components, followed by each smooth component, but excludes any offset and
any intercept. Two special cases are also allowed: type \code{latent_N} will
return the estimated latent abundances from an N-mixture distribution,
while type \code{detection} will return the estimated detection probability from
an N-mixture distribution}

\item{process_error}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} and a dynamic trend model was
fit, expected uncertainty in the process model is accounted for by using
draws from a stationary, zero-centred multivariate Normal distribution
using any estimated process variance-covariance parameters. If
\code{FALSE}, uncertainty in the latent trend component is ignored when
calculating predictions}

\item{summary}{Should summary statistics be returned
instead of the raw values? Default is \code{TRUE}..}

\item{robust}{If \code{FALSE} (the default) the mean is used as
the measure of central tendency and the standard deviation as
the measure of variability. If \code{TRUE}, the median and the
median absolute deviation (MAD) are applied instead.
Only used if \code{summary} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{probs}{The percentiles to be computed by the \code{quantile}
function. Only used if \code{summary} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Ignored}
}
\value{
Predicted values on the appropriate scale.

If \code{summary = FALSE} and \code{type != "terms"}, the output is a matrix of
dimension \verb{n_draw x n_observations} containing predicted values for each
posterior draw in \code{object}.

If \code{summary = TRUE} and \code{type != "terms"}, the output is an
\code{n_observations} x \code{E} matrix. The number of summary statistics
\code{E} is equal to \code{2 + length(probs)}: The \code{Estimate} column
contains point estimates (either mean or median depending on argument
\code{robust}), while the \code{Est.Error} column contains uncertainty
estimates (either standard deviation or median absolute deviation depending
on argument \code{robust}). The remaining columns starting with \code{Q}
contain quantile estimates as specified via argument \code{probs}.

If \code{type = "terms"} and \code{summary = FALSE}, the output is a named \code{list}
containing a separate slot for each effect, with the effects returned as
matrices of dimension \verb{n_draw x 1}. If \code{summary = TRUE}, the output
resembles that from \code{\link[mgcv]{predict.gam}} when using the call
\code{predict.gam(object, type = "terms", se.fit = TRUE)}, where mean
contributions from each effect are returned in \code{matrix} form while standard
errors (representing the interval: \code{(max(probs) - min(probs)) / 2}) are
returned in a separate \code{matrix}

\description{
Predict from a fitted \pkg{mvgam} model
}
\details{
Note that if your model included a latent temporal trend (i.e. if
you used something other than \code{"None"} for the \code{trend_model} argument), the
predictions returned by this function will ignore autocorrelation
coefficients or GP length scale coefficients by \emph{assuming the process is
stationary}. This approach is similar to how predictions are computed from
other types of regression models that can include correlated residuals,
\emph{ultimately treating the temporal dynamics as random effect nuisance
parameters}. The \code{predict} function is therefore more suited to
scenario-based posterior simulation from the GAM components of a
\code{mvgam} model, while the hindcast / forecast functions
\code{\link[=hindcast.mvgam]{hindcast.mvgam()}} and \code{\link[=forecast.mvgam]{forecast.mvgam()}} are better suited to generate
predictions that respect the temporal dynamics of estimated latent trends
at the actual time points supplied in \code{data} and \code{newdata}.
