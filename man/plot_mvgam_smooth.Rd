\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}}

\item{trend_effects}{logical. If \code{TRUE} and a \code{trend_formula} was used in model
fitting, terms from the trend (i.e. process) model will be plotted}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be plotted}

\item{smooth}{either a \code{character} or \code{integer} specifying which smooth term to be plotted}

\item{residuals}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE} then posterior quantiles of partial residuals are added
to plots of 1-D smooths as a series of ribbon rectangles.
Partial residuals for a smooth term are the median Dunn-Smyth residuals that would be obtained by dropping the term
concerned from the model, while leaving all other estimates fixed (i.e. the
estimates for the term plus the original median Dunn-Smyth residuals). Note that because \code{mvgam} works with
Dunn-Smyth residuals and not working residuals, which are used by \code{mgcv}, the magnitudes of
partial residuals will be different to what you would expect from \code{\link[mgcv]{plot.gam}}. Interpretation
is similar though, as these partial residuals should be evenly scattered
around the smooth function if the function is well estimated}

\item{n_resid_bins}{\code{integer} specifying the number of bins group the covariate into when plotting partial residuals.
Setting this argument too high can make for messy plots that are difficult to interpret, while setting it too
low will likely mask some potentially useful patterns in the partial residuals. Default is \code{25}}

\item{realisations}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, posterior realisations are shown as a spaghetti plot,
making it easier to visualise the diversity of possible functions. If \code{FALSE}, the default,
empirical quantiles of the posterior distribution are shown}

\item{n_realisations}{\code{integer} specifying the number of posterior realisations to plot, if
\code{realisations = TRUE}. Ignored otherwise}

\item{derivatives}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, an additional plot will be returned to show the
estimated 1st derivative for the specified smooth (Note, this only works for univariate smooths)}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} for predicting the smooth, containing at least 'series'
in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of the original model's \code{formula}.
Note that this currently is only supported for plotting univariate smooths}

\description{
This function plots posterior empirical quantiles for a series-specific smooth term
}
\details{
Smooth functions are shown as empirical quantiles (or spaghetti plots) of posterior partial expectations
across a sequence of 500 values between the variable's \code{min} and \code{max},
while zeroing out effects of all other variables. At present, only univariate and bivariate smooth plots
are allowed, though note that bivariate smooths rely on default behaviour from
\code{\link[mgcv]{plot.gam}}. For more nuanced visualisation, supply
\code{newdata} just as you would when predicting from a \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} model
