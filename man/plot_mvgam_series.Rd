\usage{
plot_mvgam_series(
  object,
  data,
  newdata,
  y = "y",
  lines = TRUE,
  series = 1,
  n_bins = NULL,
  log_scale = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Optional \code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}. Either
\code{object} or \code{data} must be supplied}

\item{data}{Optional \code{data.frame} or \code{list} of training data
containing at least 'series' and 'time'. Use this argument if training
data have been gathered in the correct format for \code{mvgam} modelling
but no model has yet been fitted.}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{data.frame} or \code{list} of test data
containing at least 'series' and 'time' for the forecast horizon, in
addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of
\code{formula}. If included, the observed values in the test data are
compared to the model's forecast distribution for exploring biases in
model predictions}

\item{y}{Character. What is the name of the outcome variable in the supplied
data? Defaults to \code{'y'}}

\item{lines}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, line plots are used for visualizing
time series. If \code{FALSE}, points are used.}

\item{series}{Either an \code{integer} specifying which series in the set is
to be plotted or the string 'all', which plots all series available in the
supplied data}

\item{n_bins}{\code{integer} specifying the number of bins to use for
binning observed values when plotting a histogram. Default is to use the
number of bins returned by a call to \code{hist} in base \code{R}}

\item{log_scale}{\code{logical}. If \code{series == 'all'}, this flag is
used to control whether the time series plot is shown on the log scale
(using \code{log(Y + 1)}). This can be useful when visualizing many series that
may have different observed ranges. Default is \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
A set of ggplot objects. If \code{series} is an integer, the plots
will show observed time series, autocorrelation and cumulative
distribution functions, and a histogram for the series. If
\code{series == 'all'}, a set of observed time series plots is returned in
which all series are shown on each plot but only a single focal series is
highlighted, with all remaining series shown as faint gray lines.
}
\description{
This function takes either a fitted \code{mvgam} object or a
\code{data.frame} object and produces plots of observed time series, ACF,
CDF and histograms for exploratory data analysis

\examples{
# Simulate and plot series with observations bounded at 0 and 1 (Beta responses)
sim_data <- sim_mvgam(
  family = betar(),
  trend_model = RW(),
  prop_trend = 0.6
)

plot_mvgam_series(
  data = sim_data$data_train,
  series = 'all'
)

plot_mvgam_series(
  data = sim_data$data_train,
  newdata = sim_data$data_test,
  series = 1
)

# Now simulate series with overdispersed discrete observations
sim_data <- sim_mvgam(
  family = nb(),
  trend_model = RW(),
  prop_trend = 0.6,
  phi = 10
)

plot_mvgam_series(
  data = sim_data$data_train,
  series = 'all'
)
