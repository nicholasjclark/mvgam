\usage{
\method{smooth.construct}{moi.smooth.spec}(object, data, knots)

\method{smooth.construct}{mod.smooth.spec}(object, data, knots)

\method{Predict.matrix}{moi.smooth}(object, data)

\method{Predict.matrix}{mod.smooth}(object, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A smooth specification object, usually generated by a term
\code{s(x, bs = "moi", ...)} or \code{s(x, bs = "mod", ...)}}

\item{data}{a list containing just the data (including any \code{by} variable) required by this term, 
            with names corresponding to \code{object$term} (and \code{object$by}). The \code{by} variable 
            is the last element.}

\item{knots}{a list containing any knots supplied for basis setup --- in same order and with same names as \code{data}. 
             Can be \code{NULL}. See details for further information.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"moi.smooth"} or \code{"mod.smooth"}. In addition to
the usual elements of a smooth class documented under \code{\link[mgcv]{smooth.construct}},
this object will contain a slot called \code{boundary} that defines the endpoints beyond
which the spline will begin extrapolating (extrapolation is flat due to the first
order penalty placed on the smooth function)
}
\description{
Uses constructors from package \pkg{splines2} to build monotonically increasing
or decreasing splines. Details also in Wang & Yan (2021).
}
\details{
The constructor is not normally called directly,
but is rather used internally by \link{mvgam}. If they are not supplied then the
knots of the spline are placed evenly throughout the covariate values to
which the term refers: For example, if fitting 101 data with an 11
knot spline of x then there would be a knot at every 10th (ordered) x value.
The spline is an implementation of the closed-form I-spline basis based
on the recursion formula given by Ramsay (1988), in which the basis coefficients
must be constrained to either be non-negative (for monotonically increasing
functions) or non-positive (monotonically decreasing)
\cr
\cr
Take note that when using either monotonic basis, the number of basis functions
\code{k} must be supplied as an even integer due to the manner in
which monotonic basis functions are constructed
}
\note{
This constructor will result in a valid smooth if using a call to
\code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} or \code{\link[mgcv]{bam}}, however the resulting
functions will not be guaranteed to be monotonic because constraints on
basis coefficients will not be enforced
