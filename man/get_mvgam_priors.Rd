get_mvgam_priors(
  formula,
  trend_formula,

\arguments{
\item{formula}{A \code{character} string specifying the GAM observation model formula. These are exactly like the formula
for a GLM except that smooth terms, \code{s()}, \code{te()}, \code{ti()}, \code{t2()}, as well as time-varying
\code{dynamic()} terms, can be added to the right hand side
to specify that the linear predictor depends on smooth functions of predictors
(or linear functionals of these). In \code{nmix()} family models, the \code{formula} is used to
set up a linear predictor for the detection probability. Details of the formula syntax used by \pkg{mvgam}
can be found in \code{\link{mvgam_formulae}}}

\item{trend_formula}{An optional \code{character} string specifying the GAM process model formula. If
supplied, a linear predictor will be modelled for the latent trends to capture process model evolution
separately from the observation model. Should not have a response variable specified on the left-hand side
of the formula (i.e. a valid option would be \code{~ season + s(year)}). Also note that you should not use
the identifier \code{series} in this formula to specify effects that vary across time series. Instead you should use
\code{trend}. This will ensure that models in which a \code{trend_map} is supplied will still work consistently
(i.e. by allowing effects to vary across process models, even when some time series share the same underlying
process model). This feature is only currently available for \code{RW()}, \code{AR()} and \code{VAR()} trend models.
In \code{nmix()} family models, the \code{trend_formula} is used to set up a linear predictor for the underlying
latent abundance}

\item{data}{A \code{dataframe} or \code{list} containing the model response variable and covariates
required by the GAM \code{formula} and optional \code{trend_formula}. Should include columns:
#'\itemize{
\item\code{series} (a \code{factor} index of the series IDs; the number of levels should be identical
to the number of unique series labels (i.e. \code{n_series = length(levels(data$series))}))
\item\code{time} (\code{numeric} or \code{integer} index of the time point for each observation).
For most dynamic trend types available in \code{mvgam} (see argument \code{trend_model}), time should be
measured in discrete, regularly spaced intervals (i.e. \code{c(1, 2, 3, ...)}). However you can
use irregularly spaced intervals if using \code{trend_model = CAR(1)}, though note that any
temporal intervals that are exactly \code{0} will be adjusted to a very small number
(\code{1e-12}) to prevent sampling errors. See an example of \code{CAR()} trends in \code{\link{CAR}}
}
Should also include any other variables to be included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}}

\item{data_train}{Deprecated. Still works in place of \code{data} but users are recommended to use
\code{data} instead for more seamless integration into \code{R} workflows}

\item{family}{\code{family} specifying the exponential observation family for the series. Currently supported
families are:
\itemize{
\item\code{gaussian()} for real-valued data
\item\code{betar()} for proportional data on \verb{(0,1)}
\item\code{lognormal()} for non-negative real-valued data
\item\code{student_t()} for real-valued data
\item\code{Gamma()} for non-negative real-valued data
\item\code{bernoulli()} for binary data
\item\code{nb()} for count data
\item\code{poisson()} for count data
\item\code{binomial()} for count data with imperfect detection when the number of trials is known;
note that the \code{cbind()} function must be used to bind the discrete observations and the number
of trials
\item\code{nmix()} for count data with imperfect detection when the number of trials
is unknown and should be modeled via a State-Space N-Mixture model.
The latent states are Poisson, capturing the 'true' latent
abundance, while the observation process is Binomial to account for
imperfect detection.
See \code{\link{mvgam_families}} for an example of how to use this family}
Note that only \code{nb()} and \code{poisson()} are available if using \code{JAGS} as the backend.
Default is \code{poisson()}.
See \code{\link{mvgam_families}} for more details}

\item{knots}{An optional \code{list} containing user specified knot values to be used for basis construction.
For most bases the user simply supplies the knots to be used, which must match up with the k value supplied
(note that the number of knots is not always just \code{k}). Different terms can use different numbers of knots,
unless they share a covariate}

\item{use_lv}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, use dynamic factors to estimate series'
latent trends in a reduced dimension format. Only available for
\code{RW()}, \code{AR()} and \code{GP()} trend models. Defaults to \code{FALSE}}

\item{n_lv}{\code{integer} the number of latent dynamic factors to use if \code{use_lv == TRUE}.
Cannot be \code{> n_series}. Defaults arbitrarily to \code{min(2, floor(n_series / 2))}}

\item{use_stan}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the model will be compiled and sampled using
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with a call to \code{\link[cmdstanr]{cmdstan_model}} or
a call to \code{\link[rstan]{stan}}. Note that
there are many more options when using \code{Stan} vs \code{JAGS}}

\item{trend_model}{\code{character} or  \code{function} specifying the time series dynamics for the latent trend. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{None} (no latent trend component; i.e. the GAM component is all that contributes to the linear predictor,
and the observation process is the only source of error; similarly to what is estimated by \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}})
\item \code{'RW'} or \code{RW()}
\item \code{'AR1'} or \code{AR(p = 1)}
\item \code{'AR2'} or \code{AR(p = 2)}
\item \code{'AR3'} or \code{AR(p = 3)}
\item \code{'CAR1'} or \code{CAR(p = 1)}
\item \code{'VAR1'}  or \code{VAR()}(only available in \code{Stan})
\item \verb{'PWlogistic}, \code{'PWlinear'} or \code{PW()} (only available in \code{Stan})
\item \code{'GP'} or \code{GP()} (Gaussian Process with squared exponential kernel;
only available in \code{Stan})}

For all trend types apart from \code{GP()}, \code{CAR()} and \code{PW()}, moving average and/or correlated
process error terms can also be estimated (for example, \code{RW(cor = TRUE)} will set up a
multivariate Random Walk if \code{n_series > 1}). See \link{mvgam_trends} for more details}

\item{trend_map}{Optional \code{data.frame} specifying which series should depend on which latent
trends. Useful for allowing multiple series to depend on the same latent trend process, but with
different observation processes. If supplied, a latent factor model is set up by setting
\code{use_lv = TRUE} and using the mapping to set up the shared trends. Needs to have column names
\code{series} and \code{trend}, with integer values in the \code{trend} column to state which trend each series
should depend on. The \code{series} column should have a single unique entry for each series in the
data (names should perfectly match factor levels of the \code{series} variable in \code{data}). See examples
for details}

\item{drift}{\code{logical} estimate a drift parameter in the latent trend components. Useful if the latent
trend is expected to broadly follow a non-zero slope. Only available for
\code{RW()} and \code{AR()} trend models. Note that if the latent trend is more or less stationary,
the drift parameter can become unidentifiable, especially if an intercept term is included in the GAM linear
predictor (which it is by default when calling \code{\link[mgcv]{jagam}}). Drift parameters will also likely
be unidentifiable if using dynamic factor models. Therefore this defaults to \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
either a \code{data.frame} containing the prior definitions (if any suitable
priors can be altered by the user) or \code{NULL}, indicating that no priors in the model
can be modified through the \code{mvgam} interface
}
\description{
This function lists the parameters that can have their prior distributions
changed for a given \code{mvgam} model, as well listing their default distributions
}
\details{
Users can supply a model formula, prior to fitting the model, so that default priors can be inspected and
altered. To make alterations, change the contents of the \code{prior} column and supplying this
\code{data.frame} to the \code{mvgam} function using the argument \code{priors}. If using \code{Stan} as the backend,
users can also modify the parameter bounds by modifying the \code{new_lowerbound} and/or \code{new_upperbound} columns.
This will be necessary if using restrictive distributions on some parameters, such as a Beta distribution
for the trend sd parameters for example (Beta only has support on  \code{(0,1)}), so the upperbound cannot
be above \code{1}. Another option is to make use of the prior modification functions in \code{brms}
(i.e. \code{\link[brms]{prior}}) to change prior distributions and bounds (just use the name of the parameter that
you'd like to change as the \code{class} argument; see examples below)
}
\note{
Only the \code{prior}, \code{new_lowerbound} and/or \code{new_upperbound} columns of the output
should be altered when defining the user-defined priors for the \code{mvgam} model. Use only if you are
familiar with the underlying probabilistic programming language. There are no sanity checks done to
ensure that the code is legal (i.e. to check that lower bounds are smaller than upper bounds, for
example)
