\title{Residual diagnostics for a fitted mvgam object}
\usage{
plot_mvgam_resids(object, series = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}. See \code{\link[=mvgam]{mvgam()}}}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be plotted}
}
\value{
A series of facetted ggplot object
}
\description{
This function takes a fitted \code{mvgam} object and returns various residual diagnostic plots
}
\details{
A total of four ggplot plots are generated to examine posterior
Dunn-Smyth residuals for the specified series. Plots include a residuals vs fitted values plot,
a Q-Q plot, and two plots to check for any remaining temporal autocorrelation in the residuals.
Note, all plots use only report statistics from a sample of up to 20 posterior
draws (to save computational time), so uncertainty in these relationships may not be adequately represented.

simdat <- sim_mvgam(n_series = 3, trend_model = AR())

            noncentred = TRUE,
            data = simdat$data_train,

            silent = 2)
