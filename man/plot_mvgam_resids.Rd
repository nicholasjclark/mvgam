\title{Residual diagnostics for a fitted mvgam object}
\usage{
plot_mvgam_resids(object, series = 1, n_bins = 20, newdata, data_test)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be plotted}

\item{n_bins}{\code{integer} specifying the number of bins to use for binning fitted values}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing at least 'series', 'y', and 'time'
in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}. If included, the
covariate information in \code{newdata} will be used to generate forecasts from the fitted model equations. If
this same \code{newdata} was originally included in the call to \code{mvgam}, then forecasts have already been
produced by the generative model and these will simply be extracted and used to calculate residuals.
However if no \code{newdata} was supplied to the original model call, an assumption is made that
the \code{newdata} supplied here comes sequentially after the data supplied as \code{data} in
the original model (i.e. we assume there is no time gap between the last
observation of series 1 in \code{data_train} and the first observation for series 1 in \code{newdata}).}

\item{data_test}{Deprecated. Still works in place of \code{newdata} but users are recommended to use
\code{newdata} instead for more seamless integration into \code{R} workflows}
}
\value{
A series of base \code{R} plots
}
\description{
This function takes a fitted \code{mvgam} object and returns various residual diagnostic plots
}
\details{
A total of four base \code{R} plots are generated to examine Dunn-Smyth residuals for
the specified series. Plots include a residuals vs fitted values plot,
a Q-Q plot, and two plots to check for any remaining temporal autocorrelation in the residuals.
Note, all plots use posterior medians of fitted values / residuals, so uncertainty is not represented.
