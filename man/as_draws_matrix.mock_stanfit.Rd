\title{Extract Draws from Mock stanfit}
\usage{
\method{as_draws_matrix}{mock_stanfit}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A mock_stanfit object created by create_mock_stanfit()}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (ignored, for S3 compatibility)}
}
\value{
The cached draws_matrix from the mock stanfit
}
\description{
S3 method for extracting draws from a mock stanfit object created by
create_mock_stanfit(). This method is called by brms prediction functions
to access parameter draws.
}
\details{
This method provides the core functionality of the mock stanfit pattern.
When brms calls as_draws_matrix() on our mock stanfit, it receives the
parameter subset we provided during creation.

The method simply returns the cached draws without any transformation,
maintaining the original posterior samples and parameter structure.
